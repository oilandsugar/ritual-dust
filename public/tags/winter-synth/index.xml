      <description>Painting for the cover of the first album &amp;ldquo;Three Swords&amp;rdquo; of the local dungeon synth project Aura Merlin . The concept for the album was a lonely wanderer making their way to this cave in the woods in a quest to find three magical swords.
&amp;ldquo;Attack, threaten or defend
A gift, three swords, one choice
A passage to transcend
Through a smoky cavern, a voice..&amp;rdquo;
I was inspired by Russian landscape painters from the turn of the century for the colors and ruggedness of the trees in these kinds of snow-covered landscapes.</description>

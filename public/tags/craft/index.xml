      <description>Table of contents Terms Tools Supplies Technique Safety Links Terms CYCLE; Refers to the cycle of motion of the motor of the tattoo machine, pushing the needle out and back in the tube. DWELL TIME; How long the needle is staying in the skin during it&amp;#39;s cycle. GIVE (or SPRINGYNESS); The less dwell time a machine has the more springiness or give it has. This is desirable because it reduces the chances of damaging the skin by dragging needles inside the skin while tattooing.</description>

      <description>Table of contents Interesting websites Practical knowledge The same way as I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine living in a space designed and decorated by someone else based off a generic pattern, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine my words and my work exist solely in the conformist and reductive spaces that are current day social media apps. When making this website I craved the freedom that I felt when I first started interacting and making stuff on the web as a kid.</description>

      <description>First and foremost, the most sustainable form of timber is reclaimed wood. Good sources of reclaimed wood are wooden pallets (commonly built of white oak if the wood is hard or pine if soft), timber from demolition of buildings and barns, old furniture. You can find more information on identifying pallet wood here: Identifying pallet wood .
Notes on sustainably harvested timber: buying European wood is usually a good choice because since 2010, the EU Timber Regulation enforced the replanting of trees, better forest management and limiting annual harvests.</description>

      <description>Table of contents Examples of low-tech Resources With the ongoing climate crisis, the destruction brought forth by the unsustainable push for constant growth of capitalism and a world filled with increasingly complex and disposable machines and tools, there is very strong need to scale down and simplify our technology and engineering.
Design has become on a lot of ways a self-referential discipline, focussing more and more on aesthetics over creative problem solving or, at the even more basic level, just taking the time to see if there is a problem to solve.</description>

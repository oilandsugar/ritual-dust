      <description>Tofu 11g protein per 100g
Apart from being a source of protein it is a good source of iron and calcium. Tofu is pretty neutral and versatile, it is available in silky soft (perfect for desserts) to extra firm (good for meat-like textures). If used in salty meals it&amp;rsquo;s best to marinate it and season it to give it more flavour.
For a better texture, freeze overnight, thaw the day of cooking and press for 15 to 30 minutes before cooking.</description>

      <description>Hiking and climing to see the fjords, riding kids bikes down construction lanes, eating risotto as breakfast, a first escape during the plague.
The fjords of Saguenay Tall cliffs shrouded in fog Grass-roofed cabin Dying little jumping mouse on a bed of moss Mushrooms on log Hex capturing my soul A miniature moss forest in a tiny cave Looming cabins Massive lead and wood religious statue hiding behind trees Cozy spot in the woods Endless roots growing on a boulder Late evening car ride More moss Squatting forest goth Bug-eaten stump Sneaky ferns Shadow-filled woods Towering lookout Jess standing on a boulder Just enjoying the trees The creepiest track marker Empty parking lots Very pastoral traffic cone Suburban wilderness The low tide under the setting sun </description>

      <description>Chrysopoeia is a custom all-caps typeface I designed in 2017, it&amp;rsquo;s name come from the alchemical process of turning lead and other low metals into gold. All the characters are drawn with lines of a uniform weight, something i was really into at the time. I think there&amp;rsquo;s some interesting ideas in there and I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit the concept in another typeface one day, going for something closer to the source material, possibly hand-drawn.</description>

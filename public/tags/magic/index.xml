      <description>Hand holding small boline Table of contents History Celebrations Links History of druidism Very few sources concerning the druids of the Iron age subsists to this day, most of the being accounts from Greek, Roman and christian sources. It can be interpreted from these texts that the modern image of the druid as a priestly figure presiding over sacrifices, rituals and the conservation and sharing of wisdom was mostly found amongst the druids of Gaul.</description>

      <title>Magical Correspondences</title>

      <description>Correspondences are links between different symbolic ideas, objects, moments and ingredients. These are useful in different magical and alchemical practices to enhance the effect of a spell or ritual. I also find them useful as reference to create symbolic artworks , create sigils or to be used as a guide and tool for introspection and self-discovery.

      <description>Table of contents Classical planets Modern planets Links and references The seven classical planets The Sun â˜‰ Representative of the ego, the self, the identity. Strong and powerful.
The modern symbol of the sun, the circumpunct, was first used during the Renaissance, it represents Apollo&amp;rsquo;s golden shield with a boss. The older medieval symbol (and alchemical symbol of gold) was a disk with a ray ðŸœš. In alchemy, the sun is the supreme light, the cyclical nature of the process and is associated with the conscious, energy and the ego.</description>

      <description>Pausing and listening to the rhythm of the earth while the burning wheel tumbles down the hill.
A single leaf on the ground May the sun shine warm upon your face Ripples in the water A dead branch floating in water, on it&amp;#39;s cycle to fee new life A spire poking through the trees Playing the irish bones to the rhythm of the earth </description>

      <description>Walking the urban Landscape of Montreal and noticing it&amp;rsquo;s nature, patterns and textures. Getting lost in the fragmented forest that lives beneath the city.
These photos were taken in the context of the workshop of the same name organized by Lily Hayes &amp;amp; George Saralis-Wheatley, more info can be found here: https://thelandscapeislistening.cargo.site/ </description>

      <guid>https://ritualdust.com/craft/scrying-mirror/</guid>
      <description>A mirror to look into the darkest depths. I made this scrying mirror frame out of two pieces of black-painted spruce wood tied together with waxed string - as above, so below. The pieces were carved hollow to hold the mirror without any glue - held safe but still free.</description>

      <description>All of my ritual tools are crafted by hand using hand tools with respect to the tree from which they came from. They are finished with natural linseed oil and wax for durability. After being completed they are cleansed over a flame. Unless specified, they are not created with a specific magical practice in mind and it is up to you to imbue them with your own personal meaning.
I am also open for custom work and commissions, feel free to reach out about those if youâ€™re interested :)</description>

      <title>Hellebore zine cover</title>

      <description>The good folks at Hellebore zine tasked me and Hex to make the cover image for their impromptu Yuletide edition . The theme was the celtic horned god, Cernunnos. With our interpretation of Cernunnos, we wanted to explore the darker aspects of the natural cycle while subverting the gender binary that is often attached to this ancient pagan divinity, channeling Cernunnos within a social and natural context that embraces nuance, complexity, and change.</description>

      <description>Walking on the longest night, looking inside for what&amp;rsquo;s to come.
I put on my ritual leaf crown, grabbed a lantern and ventured out in the cold empty streets and alleyways of Montreal. This was a walk I had to do alone. It was a moment I gave myself to thread new paths, going down the darkest routes without any map, open to what I could find around and inside of me.</description>

      <description>With his hollow ribcage, emaciated face and dark tattered robes, he is standing at the crossroads to help souls cross to the other side of the veil. This small ritual doll was crafted during the times leading up to Samhain this year, channeling the transformative energies of the dying season.</description>

      <description>Surreal combination of urban and natural landscape The Weird Walk zine put a name on something I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved to do, wander around cities and nature, following previously unknown paths, keeping my eyes and my mind open for new experiences and noticing weirdness when I encounter it.
I want to keep an irregular log of some of my weird walks here and add notes and references of previous weird walkers.</description>

The term sigil derives from the Latin sigillum, meaning &amp;ldquo;seal&amp;rdquo; which becomes clear when looking at the seals in the Key of Solomon for example.</description>

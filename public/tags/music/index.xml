      <description>Ashes of May by Ritual Dust A 7-min meditative drone piece that feels like taking a stroll through a field early in the morning, just in time to see the first sun rays peek at the horizon, torch in hand, on your way to light a Bealtaine bonfire.

      <description>Table of contents Layers Effects Layers Layering vocals with more takes of the same lead (called doubles), harmonies and fills creates a much richer and fuller sound giving more energy and presence to the vocals in a track.
Doubles Doubles are two other takes of the lead melody sung in the same way with the same pitches, these are then panned all the way left and right and if needed can be chopped and ajusted to fit the rythm of the main lead.</description>

      <description>A series of 4 imaginary landscape paintings for the latest EP of Inpathos called ascension . I focussed on the symbolism of the places I depicted and the feeling they conjure in order to illustrate the different songs.

      <description>Painting for the cover of the second album &amp;ldquo;Illuminations&amp;rdquo; of the local dungeon synth project Aura Merlin . This second album has more of a new age, melodic ambient vibe with still some solid dungeon synth roots. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for daydreaming or pondering the deep knowledge hidden in old illuminated medieval tomes.
The arwork for it was inspired by medieval manuscripts and the illuminations that embellishes their handwritten pages. I did quite a bit of reasearch on the iconography, the colors and the gilding techniques used back in the day to make something that felt authentic.</description>

      <description>Music video / ritual performance for the first song released by Voidxwitch , titled &amp;ldquo;are you ok?&amp;rdquo;. Shot in one night after a storm in rural Quebec.
We took plenty of inspiration from witchhouse and traumacore while developing visuals that are unique to Hex&amp;rsquo;s project. Most of the shots were lit with a light mounted on the camera to emulate old-school camcorders like the one used in Blair Witch, we also shot the whole thing handheld to be able to follow the movements of Hex during the performance and add some nice camera shake.</description>

      <description>Painting for the cover of the first album &amp;ldquo;Three Swords&amp;rdquo; of the local dungeon synth project Aura Merlin . The concept for the album was a lonely wanderer making their way to this cave in the woods in a quest to find three magical swords.
&amp;ldquo;Attack, threaten or defend
A gift, three swords, one choice
A passage to transcend
Through a smoky cavern, a voice..&amp;rdquo;
I was inspired by Russian landscape painters from the turn of the century for the colors and ruggedness of the trees in these kinds of snow-covered landscapes.</description>

      <description>Album cover and cassette sleeve design for the first Blood and Dust release. The texture used as a background to the design was photographed indoors from soil, leaves and branches collected outside and with the addition of a good amount of fake blood. The concept for this album design, especially the cassette version was to make a physical vessel to contain the music, like an ancient cursed object holding the intense emotions and energy channelled in the songs.</description>

      <description>Exploring the charred remnants of a very old and very cursed house and it&amp;rsquo;s neighbouring cemetery.
The Boleskine burial ground A faded sign marks the entrance of the cemetery Moss covered gravestones with the Loch Ness in the distance Gravestone detail The old gate lies abandoned Old monuments A strange boarded up stone house lies in a corner I step on a stone and reach in the broken window Little 666 engraved on the window frame Peaking inside, there is a fireplace with a strange occult symbold carved in the mantelpiece A trapdoor with a some ghostly dust flying around Ancient and long gone monuments General view of the burial grounds The Boleskine house Boleskine house, at least what&amp;#39;s left of it On old door frame in the ruins More doorways Glass bottle, melted by the inferno View through one of the windows More doorways The main door, partially intact A corridor filled with debris Looking out to the mountains Another corridor, this one leading to the basement stairs Stairs to the basement What&amp;#39;s left of the fireplace </description>

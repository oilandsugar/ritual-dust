      <description>I recently had the chance to work on the soundtrack for a narrated story called &amp;ldquo;Crust&amp;rdquo; released on the Library of the Occult label with Blood and Dust . The story is set in 1976 in rural England in the little town of Greenwood located close to a bog called Andertons Moss where in 1951 a well preserved prehistoric bog body apparently offered to the waters as ritual sacrifice was discovered.</description>

      <description>I made a handle for an existing chain and spiky ball that I got as a gift in order to turn them into a flail replica. The feel of the leather on the handle and the weight of the chain and ball is really nice, makes you want to fight enemies in a dank dungeon.
The flail, it&amp;#39;s long chain and spiky ball The whole thing in context </description>

      <description>I repainted and added a wooden handle to this toy scythe we found in a thrift store. I find it has quite a Giger-esque feel to it and works wonders as a photo prop now.

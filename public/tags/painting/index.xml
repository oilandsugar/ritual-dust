      <description>Album covers I can do album covers in pencil, as an acrylic painting or with processed photography. In all cases, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the concept of the album, its themes, and how they should be represented visually. From there, if we go with illustration or painting I&amp;rsquo;ll do sketches, a round of adjustments and complete the final piece. Please note that I only do things that fit my illustration style ( see here for reference ).</description>

      <description>A series of 4 imaginary landscape paintings for the latest EP of Inpathos called ascension . I focussed on the symbolism of the places I depicted and the feeling they conjure in order to illustrate the different songs.
Painting of shores with high rocky cliffs and blue moonin the distance Painting of the snowy peak of a mountain lost in the clouds Painting of dense woods with a stream going through it, the background fading to fog Painting for the cover of the album, a mountain pass with steep cliffs and some mountains in the distance, a branch crosses the path we&amp;#39;re on and storm clouds are gathering overhead </description>

      <title>Illuminations Album Cover</title>

      <description>Painting for the cover of the second album &amp;ldquo;Illuminations&amp;rdquo; of the local dungeon synth project Aura Merlin . This second album has more of a new age, melodic ambient vibe with still some solid dungeon synth roots. It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for daydreaming or pondering the deep knowledge hidden in old illuminated medieval tomes.
The arwork for it was inspired by medieval manuscripts and the illuminations that embellishes their handwritten pages. I did quite a bit of reasearch on the iconography, the colors and the gilding techniques used back in the day to make something that felt authentic.</description>

      <title>Three Swords Album Cover</title>
      <link>https://ritualdust.com/works/paintings/aura-merlin-3-swords/</link>

      <description>Painting for the cover of the first album &amp;ldquo;Three Swords&amp;rdquo; of the local dungeon synth project Aura Merlin . The concept for the album was a lonely wanderer making their way to this cave in the woods in a quest to find three magical swords.
&amp;ldquo;Attack, threaten or defend
A gift, three swords, one choice
A passage to transcend
Through a smoky cavern, a voice..&amp;rdquo;
I was inspired by Russian landscape painters from the turn of the century for the colors and ruggedness of the trees in these kinds of snow-covered landscapes.</description>

Final painting, an oil lamp lit with a sigil to the son overlaid over it On winter solstice of this year 2021, I had the feeling that I should take painting back again, after more than 10 years. For a year now I&amp;rsquo;ve been going on personal and artistic journeys on the solstices and equinoxes, looking for insights and inspiration.</description>

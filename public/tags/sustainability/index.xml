      <title>Post-Civilization Anarchism</title>

      <description>Post Civilization is an idea that I&amp;rsquo;ve first encountered when I was about 18, still in university, very much a self-described anarchist and at the time quite active in the student movements. Revisiting this idea of a way of living post-civilization that is more sustainable, more equal and more fulfilling still rings true 14 years later with the current climate crisis and the constant train wreck of late-stage capitalism.
The first iteration of that philosophy comes from a small zine published by Strangers In a Tangled Wilderness called Post-Civ!</description>

      <description>Small stream with native plants and logs Table of contents Introduction Concrete examples Links Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s no mystery that our relationship to nature and the way ecosystems work has shifted dramatically over time, basically almost from the time we started large scale cultivation of crops. Things got further aggravated during colonization with the import of exotic plants, animals and bugs that disrupted the existing relationships and balance present in the native ecosystem.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about making a portable low-power resilient computer for quite a while and have been slowly assembling the parts that i&amp;rsquo;ll use to make it. My main goal with it is to have a backup computer if my macbook crashes.
Inspirations: https://back7.co/home/the-raspberry-pi-quick-kit http://opacity.ru/cyberdeck https://cyberdeck.cafe/build https://alternativebit.fr/posts/ultimate-writer/ It needs to run all the software tools I need to daily and creative tasks work offline and connect to the internet run on battery power, grid power or solar power is easy to repair and upgrade if needed Parts acquired so far Raspberry Pi 4 (dimensions 4‚Äù x 2.</description>

      <title>Wood species</title>

      <description>First and foremost, the most sustainable form of timber is reclaimed wood. Good sources of reclaimed wood are wooden pallets (commonly built of white oak if the wood is hard or pine if soft), timber from demolition of buildings and barns, old furniture. You can find more information on identifying pallet wood here: Identifying pallet wood .
Notes on sustainably harvested timber: buying European wood is usually a good choice because since 2010, the EU Timber Regulation enforced the replanting of trees, better forest management and limiting annual harvests.</description>

      <description>Table of contents Examples of low-tech Resources With the ongoing climate crisis, the destruction brought forth by the unsustainable push for constant growth of capitalism and a world filled with increasingly complex and disposable machines and tools, there is very strong need to scale down and simplify our technology and engineering.
Design has become on a lot of ways a self-referential discipline, focussing more and more on aesthetics over creative problem solving or, at the even more basic level, just taking the time to see if there is a problem to solve.</description>

      <title>Off-grid living</title>
      <link>https://ritualdust.com/craft/off-grid-living/</link>

      <description>This is a very organic gathering of my notes and research on living off-grid, either in a home or in a vehicule (like a boat or a van). I have a dream of building a timber framed house in the woods at some points and to have a van or a boat setup for short-term living so these notes act as preparation, planning and inspiration for those projects.
Table of contents Power Water Fuel Internet Heating Lighting Computers Shower Toilet Insurance Safety Links Power The house and vehicule have quite different power needs, but in a perfect world they would both be powered by renewable energy.</description>

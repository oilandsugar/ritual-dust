      <description>Together with my friend Steven, we&amp;rsquo;re building a fictional fantasy world called Pious Rot, we started with some of the legendary weapons and their lore and we&amp;rsquo;ll keep going from there. I&amp;rsquo;m putting together these pages for each weapon like if they were part of a full book (hopefully we get to actually make the book one day) with all the stats, the story and the illustrations .</description>

      <description>In collaboration with my friend Steven, I&amp;rsquo;m illustrating a series of TTRPG weapons from a fantasy world we&amp;rsquo;re creating called Pious Rot. Every weapon has some lore and stats attached to it which informs the illustration I make for it. We&amp;rsquo;re also making these following different parts of the fantasy world and I try to create a sense of local culture and craft between them. We&amp;rsquo;re making a new one every week for the time being until we&amp;rsquo;re done with all the regions of the world.</description>

      <description>Band / Project logo I have quite a bit of experience doing lettering work and logos for bands of a good range of genres but mostly black metal, doom, dungeon synth, noise and experimental music.
When you commission me a logo, the first step is talking a bit more with you about what you’re envisioning and getting any inspirations that you like as a reference point (you can also just give me wildcard and I’ll work from the music and the name itself).</description>

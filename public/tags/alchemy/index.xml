      <description>Table of contents Classical planets Modern planets Links and references The seven classical planets The Sun â˜‰ Representative of the ego, the self, the identity. Strong and powerful.
The modern symbol of the sun, the circumpunct, was first used during the Renaissance, it represents Apollo&amp;rsquo;s golden shield with a boss. The older medieval symbol (and alchemical symbol of gold) was a disk with a ray ðŸœš. In alchemy, the sun is the supreme light, the cyclical nature of the process and is associated with the conscious, energy and the ego.</description>

      <description>Chrysopoeia is a custom all-caps typeface I designed in 2017, it&amp;rsquo;s name come from the alchemical process of turning lead and other low metals into gold. All the characters are drawn with lines of a uniform weight, something i was really into at the time. I think there&amp;rsquo;s some interesting ideas in there and I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit the concept in another typeface one day, going for something closer to the source material, possibly hand-drawn.</description>

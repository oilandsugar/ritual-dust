      <description>Thick fog was rising from the ground like in a victorian gothic story.
An old brick school with a row of trees disappearing in the fog Trees vaguely visible in the fog Trees and a pointy roof vaguely visible in the fog Headlights shining on a street drenched in fog Large tree with smaller ones slowly fading in the distance Path in a fog covered park Church visible in the distant fog, with leafless trees in the foreground Tortured tree against a fog backdrop Church steeple with some branches Old church in the fog Large brick school with low rolling fog and a tree in the foreground Fenced area in a park covered in fog </description>

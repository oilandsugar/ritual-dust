      <description>Thick fog was rising from the ground like in a victorian gothic story.

      <title>Cemetery Walk Samhain 2022</title>

      <description>On the eve of Samhain we ventured out at the end of the day to go visit the ruin of the Calvin Presbyterian Church and it&amp;rsquo;s cemetery in the small rural town of Saint-Anicet in Quebec. The whole place was surprisingly well maintained (compared to how it looked in 2002) and contained a wealth of ancient tombstones.
The church was once part of a settlement comprised of people with French, Irish, and Scottish heritage called Godmanchester Village created in the 1820&amp;rsquo;s which only survived around 30 years and was then abandoned.</description>

      <description>Ghostly portraits of Hex and Kita in the style of victorian spirit photographs. The ghost effect was made in camera and the daguerreotype feel was achieved in editing. A detailed how-to is available on my patreon .

      <description>This ongoing series documents my personal collections of artifacts, some with historical significance, some purely some stick or rock found in the woods somewhere, but all with meaning and a past of future story attached to them. In archeology, artifacts are only as precious as their well-documented provenance and context that allows them to tell a more complete story. These items that I found, unearthed or bought have a story of their own but also a story that I made for them, this is an exercise in collecting those stories so they can be shared and hopefully inspire other people to create stories of their own for their favourite found objects.</description>

      <description>Hiking and climing to see the fjords, riding kids bikes down construction lanes, eating risotto as breakfast, a first escape during the plague.
The fjords of Saguenay Tall cliffs shrouded in fog Grass-roofed cabin Dying little jumping mouse on a bed of moss Mushrooms on log Hex capturing my soul A miniature moss forest in a tiny cave Looming cabins Massive lead and wood religious statue hiding behind trees Cozy spot in the woods Endless roots growing on a boulder Late evening car ride More moss Squatting forest goth Bug-eaten stump Sneaky ferns Shadow-filled woods Towering lookout Jess standing on a boulder Just enjoying the trees The creepiest track marker Empty parking lots Very pastoral traffic cone Suburban wilderness The low tide under the setting sun </description>

      <description>The good folks at Hellebore zine tasked me and Hex to make the cover image for their impromptu Yuletide edition . The theme was the celtic horned god, Cernunnos. With our interpretation of Cernunnos, we wanted to explore the darker aspects of the natural cycle while subverting the gender binary that is often attached to this ancient pagan divinity, channeling Cernunnos within a social and natural context that embraces nuance, complexity, and change.</description>

      <description>A series of cinematic shots of the Montreal suburbs trying to capture the feeling of unease, distrust and inhospitality of higher middle class white neighbourhoods.
Entering a shadowy backyard A mysterious hole in the ground filled with concrete debris Empty windows looming, covered in vine Perfect spot to peak at passerbys through the blinds and the overgrown bushes Windows like empty eyes trapped behind fences The local church Houses built like an overprotective parent with a gaping mouth as a door Little signs letting you that there&amp;#39;s always someone watching Who knows what happens behind closed (garage) doors </description>

      <description>Exploring the miniature landscapes found in nature, microcosms contained into and evoking the larger landscapes that they are part of.
Snow covered cliff with small bushes poking through A patch of long grass amongst the snow Tumultuous waters rushing through boulders Fallen tree in the woods with melting snow Strong waters, freezed in time Sun rays on a frozen lake with a large broken tree in the distance A small clearing with sticks and leaves on a blanket of snow </description>

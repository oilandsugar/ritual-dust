      <description>Post Civilization is an idea that I&amp;rsquo;ve first encountered when I was about 18, still in university, very much a self-described anarchist and at the time quite active in the student movements. Revisiting this idea of a way of living post-civilization that is more sustainable, more equal and more fulfilling still rings true 14 years later with the current climate crisis and the constant train wreck of late-stage capitalism.
The first iteration of that philosophy comes from a small zine published by Strangers In a Tangled Wilderness called Post-Civ!</description>

      <description>This is in no way intended to be general advice or universal truth, it&amp;rsquo;s what worked for me in life so far. These are the result of a long distillation process, introspection, life experiences, therapy and meditation. It will definitely change in the future, like myself. It is written in that form as a message from present me to future me.
Table of contents Listen to nature Know your feelings Trust your body Set boundaries Take accountability Practice gratitude Learn your privilege Tend to your insecurities Be honest with yourself Commitments not tasks Cultivate a relationship with nature Nature is always there somewhere, even in the most brutalist city corners and we&amp;rsquo;re part of it.</description>

      <description>I no more feel like a ghost, i feel like the earth, the soil with itâ€™s deep and complex network of roots and mycelium, with a whole ecosystem of bugs and living things crawling around. I can feel the cover of dead leaves and rotting fruit accumulated on top of me, not hindering my feelings but comforting like a blanket, protecting the bulbs and the nuts that fell on the ground at the turn of the seasons, allowing them to slowly get ready to bloom in the spring, feeding on this bed of decomposing remnants from the past.</description>

      <description>Hand holding small boline Table of contents History Celebrations Links History of druidism Very few sources concerning the druids of the Iron age subsists to this day, most of the being accounts from Greek, Roman and christian sources. It can be interpreted from these texts that the modern image of the druid as a priestly figure presiding over sacrifices, rituals and the conservation and sharing of wisdom was mostly found amongst the druids of Gaul.</description>

      <title>Witches Flying Ointment</title>

      <description>Flying ointment or salve is a potentially hallucinogenic and highly toxic blend of plants in a fatty base that appears in folklore, fiction and books relating to witch hunting dating back to the middle ages. There&amp;rsquo;s still quite a bit of debate amongst folklorists and researchers on whether such ointments actually existed, if they actually contained the toxic and hallucinogenic plants often associated with them and whether they are one of the sources of the myth of the witch flying on a broom (the theory being that witches would craft mind-altering flying ointment, apply it on a broom stick and &amp;ldquo;ride&amp;rdquo; it in order to &amp;ldquo;fly&amp;rdquo;, in a combination of sexual stimulation, trance state and possibly vivid dreams and visions of flying).</description>

      <title>Post-Civilization Anarchism</title>
      <link>https://ritualdust.com/folklore/anarchism/</link>

      <guid>https://ritualdust.com/folklore/anarchism/</guid>
      <description>Post Civilization is an idea that I&amp;rsquo;ve first encountered when I was about 18, still in university, very much a self-described anarchist and at the time quite active in the student movements. Revisiting this idea of a way of living post-civilization that is more sustainable, more equal and more fulfilling still rings true 14 years later with the current climate crisis and the constant train wreck of late-stage capitalism.
The first iteration of that philosophy comes from a small zine published by Strangers In a Tangled Wilderness called Post-Civ!</description>

      <guid>https://ritualdust.com/folklore/correspondences/</guid>
      <description>Correspondences are links between different symbolic ideas, objects, moments and ingredients. These are useful in different magical and alchemical practices to enhance the effect of a spell or ritual. I also find them useful as reference to create symbolic artworks , create sigils or to be used as a guide and tool for introspection and self-discovery.

      <description>Table of contents Classical planets Modern planets Links and references The seven classical planets The Sun â˜‰ Representative of the ego, the self, the identity. Strong and powerful.
The modern symbol of the sun, the circumpunct, was first used during the Renaissance, it represents Apollo&amp;rsquo;s golden shield with a boss. The older medieval symbol (and alchemical symbol of gold) was a disk with a ray ðŸœš. In alchemy, the sun is the supreme light, the cyclical nature of the process and is associated with the conscious, energy and the ego.</description>

The term sigil derives from the Latin sigillum, meaning &amp;ldquo;seal&amp;rdquo; which becomes clear when looking at the seals in the Key of Solomon for example.</description>

      <description>Pausing and listening to the rhythm of the earth while the burning wheel tumbles down the hill.
A single leaf on the ground May the sun shine warm upon your face Ripples in the water A dead branch floating in water, on it&amp;#39;s cycle to fee new life A spire poking through the trees Playing the irish bones to the rhythm of the earth </description>

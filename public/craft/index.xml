Things got further aggravated during colonization with the import of exotic plants, animals and bugs that disrupted the existing relationships and balance present in the native ecosystem.</description>

      <description>I recently had the chance to work on the soundtrack for a narrated story called &amp;ldquo;Crust&amp;rdquo; released on the Library of the Occult label with Blood and Dust . The story is set in 1976 in rural England in the little town of Greenwood located close to a bog called Andertons Moss where in 1951 a well preserved prehistoric bog body apparently offered to the waters as ritual sacrifice was discovered.</description>

      <description>I sculpted this vampiric lock on top of a real steel padlock and kept it functional. The inspiration for it was a drawing I made last year which you can find in my Sketchbook of December 2020 . My intent was to make something that feels old and a bit out of time and slightly threatening, something you think twice before unlocking.

      <description>I made a handle for an existing chain and spiky ball that I got as a gift in order to turn them into a flail replica. The feel of the leather on the handle and the weight of the chain and ball is really nice, makes you want to fight enemies in a dank dungeon.

      <description>Table of contents Terms Tools Supplies Technique Safety Links Terms CYCLE; Refers to the cycle of motion of the motor of the tattoo machine, pushing the needle out and back in the tube. DWELL TIME; How long the needle is staying in the skin during it&amp;#39;s cycle. GIVE (or SPRINGYNESS); The less dwell time a machine has the more springiness or give it has. This is desirable because it reduces the chances of damaging the skin by dragging needles inside the skin while tattooing.</description>

      <description>I made this leather belt out of scraps of leather and metal rings years ago, I recently added some removable chains and straps to it. I carry on it my small sickle, a mask and sometimes I hang other useful things from the rings when I go out.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about making a portable low-power resilient computer for quite a while and have been slowly assembling the parts that i&amp;rsquo;ll use to make it. My main goal with it is to have a backup computer if my macbook crashes.

      <description>The original vambits were a small run of laser cut acrylic toys designed by the folks at Hundred Rabbits , I had it laying around on my desk for years and it always had a missing art and antler. Since it was already a bit damaged it gave me the idea of making it really rough looking while practicing my miniature painting skills at the same time.

      <description>A while ago I found this little ball-peen hammer in an antique store, it had a handle at the time but it ended up breaking with use at the thinner part. The head sat in my tool chest for a couple years until recently when I started to work on my new tool chest project .
With this new motivation to get all my tools together in a new home, I wanted to give this little guy a new handle.</description>

      <description>After years of thinking about it and pushing the project back, I finally tackled the building of a proper home for my hand tools. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to use as much of the wood I already have around to make it and the actual structure once was the case containing the first ever modular synth that I put together as a teen.
Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to draw a full precise plan of it and every tool, here are the guiding principles that I used as I fitted the tools:</description>

      <guid>https://ritualdust.com/craft/wood-species/</guid>
      <description>First and foremost, the most sustainable form of timber is reclaimed wood. Good sources of reclaimed wood are wooden pallets (commonly built of white oak if the wood is hard or pine if soft), timber from demolition of buildings and barns, old furniture. You can find more information on identifying pallet wood here: Identifying pallet wood .
Notes on sustainably harvested timber: buying European wood is usually a good choice because since 2010, the EU Timber Regulation enforced the replanting of trees, better forest management and limiting annual harvests.</description>

      <description>This coat hanger is built in a mix of neo-gothic and eastlake styles out of knotty pine, with moldings and cutout details. The hardware is cast iron and comes from a local company. The whole thing was stained and weathered to look like an antique piece of furniture and hopefully it lives long enough to become one.</description>

      <description>This was my first effect pedal built. It is based on a clone of the Boss DS-1 classic distortion pedal. I was built for my music project Blood and Dust as part of an effect chain we use on a cello. It is primarily used to make sounds heavier, grittier and add this sense of dread that is permeating our music.

After being completed they are cleansed over a flame. Unless specified, they are not created with a specific magical practice in mind and it is up to you to imbue them with your own personal meaning.

      <description>Table of contents Examples of low-tech Resources With the ongoing climate crisis, the destruction brought forth by the unsustainable push for constant growth of capitalism and a world filled with increasingly complex and disposable machines and tools, there is very strong need to scale down and simplify our technology and engineering.
Design has become on a lot of ways a self-referential discipline, focussing more and more on aesthetics over creative problem solving or, at the even more basic level, just taking the time to see if there is a problem to solve.</description>

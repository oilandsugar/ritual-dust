      <description>Album covers I can do album covers in pencil, as an acrylic painting or with processed photography. In all cases, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the concept of the album, its themes, and how they should be represented visually. From there, if we go with illustration or painting I&amp;rsquo;ll do sketches, a round of adjustments and complete the final piece. Please note that I only do things that fit my illustration style ( see here for reference ).</description>

      <description>In collaboration with my friend Steven, I&amp;rsquo;m illustrating a series of TTRPG weapons from a fantasy world we&amp;rsquo;re creating called Pious Rot. Every weapon has some lore and stats attached to it which informs the illustration I make for it. We&amp;rsquo;re also making these following different parts of the fantasy world and I try to create a sense of local culture and craft between them. We&amp;rsquo;re making a new one every week for the time being until we&amp;rsquo;re done with all the regions of the world.</description>

      <title>Fantômes Zine - issue 1</title>
      <link>https://ritualdust.com/works/illustration/fantomes-zine-issue-1/</link>

      <description>Fantômes was my first zine project, one that started very small when I realized that I could regroup in a zine my obsession with ghosts, the drawings I made of them and the photos of ghostly places I took. Then I asked around to see if other people would be interested in creating or writing pieces about ghosts, and got an incredible response. I then spent the next 6 months collecting, assembling, laying out and illustrating all that material to form what became the first issue of this little zine.</description>

      <description>A pencil drawing inspired by the alpine folk-horror game Mundaun . I was really fascinated by it&amp;rsquo;s locations, characters, objects and beautiful hand-pencilled textures that blend the whole world of the game into a morphing and moving drawing.

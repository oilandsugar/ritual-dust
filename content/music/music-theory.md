## Intervals

In western tonal music, the musical range of instruments is subdivided into 12 equal parts separated from each other by a half-step (which on a keyboard is the jump from one note to the next). Each of these representing a note in the chromatic scale.
The difference between different of these notes are called intervals and are measured in <strong class="accent">half-steps</strong> or <strong class="accent">whole steps</strong>.

## Keys, scales and modes

These are all the keys in the western classical musical tradition, which are the most commonly used in contemporary electronic music.

### Modes  

Scales can have different modes, which are the same sequence of notes as the note's major scale but starting on a different note.

## Chords and progressions



## Composition and structure

### The Five Arrangement Elements

It’s helpful to break an arrangement down into these five main elements, bearing in mind that some instruments may do different jobs at different parts in a song, or even fulfill multiple roles at once:
- Foundation: This is usually the rhythm section - drums providing the major pulse of the song that you would feel and count along to, and bass providing harmonic context for all other pitched instruments. The rest of the arrangement is built upon the foundation.
- Pads: Long sustained sounds - often chords, notes, or atmospheric effects which are held to fill some of the background space.
- Rhythm: Rhythm is any instrument that plays off of the Foundation’s pulse, adding movement and excitement to the track.
- Lead: What you would sing along to and probably pay the most attention to when listening.
- Fills: Fills occupy the spaces in between Lead lines to maintain interest when it’s natural for the main melody to take a break.

### Tension and Release

- Harmonic tension: The root chord of the key of your song is the most stable and resolved harmonic position. Tension is introduced as you move to other chords, as well as by accompanying them with some lead or bass notes which fit in less “expected” ways, i.e. notes that are outside of the current chord.
- Rhythmic tension: A lot of fun and interest comes from accentuating “weaker” beats - mainly, ones that don’t fall on the quarter note “1 2 3 4” that you would typically count along to most songs with. Think about rhythmic tension not only for typical “rhythm” parts like percussion, but also the rhythm of your main melody or the rhythm of the chord changes.
As you’re working, consider how tension and release play out across every aspect of your song - the impression of the introduction, the quantization of notes, the length of a buildup, contrasts in volume or brightness...


### Melody aspects

phrase - repetition of bunch of notes with same rythm but can change in pitch
chords - multiple notes played together, often accompanying melody
range - range of notes on scale applied to a melody
higher notes towards the end
keep the phrase length the same overall

I make music as [Ritual Dust](https://ritualdust.bandcamp.com/), [Blood and Dust](https://blood-and-dust.com/) (with Hex) and work as a producer under the name [L1ZB3TH](https://l1zb3th.bandcamp.com/) for Hex's solo project [Voidxwitch](https://voidxwitch.com/). My main instruments are drums (both acoustic and electronic) and synthesizers (especially modular ones). I have a deep interest in ritual music, ancient music, electronic and industrial music.

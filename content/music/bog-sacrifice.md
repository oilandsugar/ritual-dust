Climate rage and field recordings taken in the Carrickynaghtan Bog were the main ingredients used in the crafting of this track. They were then fused and charged through feedback loops, layers of distorted drums and the alchemical transformation process of the Strega.

Originally recorded for "Elmet Brae", a drone compilation put together by the Merveilles community.

### Digital and Analog systems

Recording audio can be done with either an analog or digital system (and media). Analog systems like tape recorders and analog pre-amps don't transfer the signal to an digital signal but passes it through as a changing voltage. Digital systems are more commons these days for practicality and cost but a lot of people still use some combination of analog and digital gear in their recording process.

Analog systems are more forgiving to louder volumes and the distortion and saturation that can happen when a signal approach it's limits is usually pleasing, whereas an digital system will clip the audio that excedes it's limits, making the recording unusable. It's then usually preferable to record louder on analog systems (peaks around 0 VU) than digital systems (peaks around -12db FS). Recording louder on an analog system also helps keep the ratio between the good signal and the noise floor greater so that if the signal is then further amplified, the noise doesn't become too much of a problem.

Pre-amps serves the purpose of taking a very weak signal like one from a microphone (which is usually in microvolts) and boost it to line level so it can integrate with other instruments in a mix.

**Tips**

- maximize the signal to noise ratio to avoid problems down the road
- try to keep a good dynamic range
- aim for peaks at 0 VU on an analog system
- aim for peaks at -12db FS on an digital system

### Gain staging

There is multiple points where the gain can be adjusted in a recording chain in addition to the microphone preamp (or the input gain on an audio interface). Start at the output level of your sound source (if there is one), 80% volume is a good place to start. Then adjust the gain on the input preamp to the levels described above.

### Microphone and pre-amp settings

for SM7B

on the back there is two toggle switches, one to rollout the lows and the other for boosting the mids
best if used with a clean boost in the chain before going to an interface or pre-amp, we're using the cloudlifter for this.

for SM58

no settings for this microphone

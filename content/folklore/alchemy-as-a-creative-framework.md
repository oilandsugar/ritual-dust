Art as an alchemical process, not alchemy as a metaphor of creation

The work and the making and the documentation are central

Search for immortality, through the work that survives you and becomes significant
Nothing is universally significant tho, it all depends in context, one should not strive for universally meaningful work because it then loses it’s deep meaning for the self.

The 4 stages

nigredo, a blackening or melanosis

In alchemy, nigredo, or blackness, means putrefaction or decomposition. Many alchemists believed that as a first step in the pathway to the philosopher's stone, all alchemical ingredients had to be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter

albedo, a whitening or leucosis

In alchemy, albedo is the second of the four major stages of the magnum opus, along with nigredo, citrinitas and rubedo.[1] It is a Latinicized term meaning "whiteness". Following the chaos or massa confusa of the nigredo stage, the alchemist undertakes a purification in albedo, which is literally referred to as ablutio – the washing away of impurities. This phase is concerned with "bringing light and clarity to the prima materia (the First Matter)".

citrinitas, a yellowing or xanthosis

Citrinitas, or sometimes xanthosis,[1] is a term given by alchemists to "yellowness." It is one of the four major stages of the alchemical magnum opus. In alchemical philosophy, citrinitas stood for the dawning of the "solar light" inherent in one's being, and that the reflective "lunar or soul light" was no longer necessary.

rubedo, a reddening, purpling, or iosis

Rubedo is a Latin word meaning "redness" that was adopted by alchemists to define the fourth and final major stage in their magnum opus.[1] Both gold and the philosopher's stone were associated with the color red, as rubedo signaled alchemical success, and the end of the great work.

Finding meaning in the making in the process, like the alchemical process the real purpose wasn’t to turn vile matter into gold, it wasn’t the result that mattered but the process of searching and learning

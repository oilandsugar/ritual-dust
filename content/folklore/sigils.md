## What are sigils

> “In the field of the truly esoteric, words are the sigils of power that form as the inner world takes outer form. They develop a greater meaning and purpose as we formulate the grand sum of experience into singular flowing points. Even the act of writing is itself a magical act, a ritualistic focusing and a scriptural act of devotion.”

## Austin Osman Spare

The work of Austin Osman Spare, a British artist and occultist informed a lot of what we call sigil magic today. We can see references to his own system to make sigils out of combined letters in contemporary chaos magick. I'm especially interested in how he integrated aspects of Art Nouveau and Symbolism in the characters and symbols he drew, there is something strong that draws me to these types of organic and line-based shapes.

## My own sigil work

### A sigil for the self, as a signature

My new sigil, created as part of my gender transition process breaks away from the rigidity and cleanness of the previous symbol, embracing imperfections and intuition in it's drawing. It's elements intersecting and colliding without being constrained.

The oil and sugar symbol originates from an old stylized signature from my
art school years. While doing some research on alchemical iconography I
realized that the two symbols formed by this combination of the letters T
O & M corresponded to the alchemical symbols for oil and sugar, hence the
name.

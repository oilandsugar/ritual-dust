I've been curious about leylines ever since hearing about them in Children of the stones. While researching them I found the work of Alfred Watkins who popularized the idea in his book The old Straight Track. Of course, leylines in the sense of lines of energy circling the earth and connecting ancient pagan monuments have been debunked by archeologists, but they are still interesting to explore be it even just for how they change our relationship with the landscape, allow us to experience it in a more conscious way as we move around on the earth.  

One important thing to remember as a white person and colonizer on native land is that even tho I can have a deep relationship with the landscape and the earth on which I live on, it has to pass through acknowledging how my ancestors dispossessed the native people who have been taking care of this land for thousands of years before our arrival. Listening to the earth and it's energy, particularly in very charged places and landmarks is going to reveal it's story to you; a story that often includes a lot of bloodshed and human and animal suffering.

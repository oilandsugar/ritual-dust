Samhradh (which translates to summer) marks midsummer, the summer solstice and the longest day of the year and the time when the sun is in it's highest position in the sky. It is celebrated on or around ***June 20th*** in the northern hemisphere. In Ireland, it was overshadowed by St-John's eve or bonfire night over the years.

## Rituals and traditions

### Lighting of bonfires

Bonfires were lit at night of Samradh, from these bonfires, burning branches (or sometimes ashes or coals) were brought into the fields that were planted that year and scattered there to help the crops yield a good harvest. Bones could be thrown in the fire as an offering.

Often two bonfires were lit pretty close to each other and cattle was driven between them to ensure their good health for the coming season.

## Ancient monuments associated with it

### The Grange stone circle

The Grange stone circle in County Limerick is thought to have been built in alignment with the rising sun at Samhradh.

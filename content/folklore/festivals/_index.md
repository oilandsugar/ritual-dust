The ancient Celtic pagan festivals marking important transition points during the year go back a very long time. With the coming of Wicca and neo-paganism a lot of those were appropriated and added to a new wheel of the year containing 8 festivals. When presenting these here I want to take a different approach and go back to the roots of the festivals, de-entangle them from their new age associations as much as I can and put them back into their historical and cultural context (with a focus on Irish traditions). For this reason I will use modern Irish names for all the festivals (along with the old Irish versions) but stay clear from the newer names and the anglicized ones.

The holidays or festivals can be separated into two groups: **the fire festivals** with a focus on community, hearth and home and the otherworld and **the cross quarters** with a focus on community, the land and this world. If we go back far enough, there used to only two seasons, winter and summer, the transition points between these two being times of great change and instability, associated with the movement of communities from one camp to another.

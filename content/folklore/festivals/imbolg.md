Imbolg is an ancient Celtic festival and celebration that takes place on *Feburary 1st* in the northern hemisphere. Imbolg is a fire festival celebrating the promise of the return of spring or the rekindling of the solar hearth.

This festival is associated with the goddess Brigid (or BrÃ­g) who is associated with wisdom, poetry, arts and crafts, healing, protection, blacksmithing and domesticated animals. It is said that Bridgid started the custom of keening.

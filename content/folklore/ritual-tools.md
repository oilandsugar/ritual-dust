This page collects research and personal notes on how I use a selection of ritual and magical tools. I would like to start by mentioning that magic does not require any tools and that a connection to oneself, the world around us, it's stories and it's inherent magic is more important than any tool, ritual or supply one could use in a practice. Tools for me are a way to symbolize and channel magical intentions and act as reminders of the process in between rituals.

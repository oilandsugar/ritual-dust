"The fantasy of escaping to a place beyond history is, ultimately, the fantasy of unaccountability. It spares the visitor from reckoning with the political, social and economic forces which have interacted with ecological forces to shape the landscape, while allowing them to indulge in the idea that they are self-created, forged in the absence of external cultural stimuli."

“Queerness is as old and complex as lichen”

“This queer storying of the land is a salve to the cultural wounds of settler colonialism. These wounds manifest in the narrative of not belonging, being unnatural, or being targeted for embodiments outside of cisheteropatriarchy and whiteness including transness, blackness, indigeneity, nonbinary, queerness, neurodivergence, and the diversity of intersections in between.”

« This is typical of the short-sighted view we British have of our own pre-history.
Look at our buildings, our heros, the way we work ourselves into the ground, the dark history of our imperialism and we look like the sons and daughters of Rome. But we are not. Being invaded by the romans had a terrible effect, not only on how we view our own history but on how we developed as a nation. We’ve come to believe that the roman colonization of this country was a civilizing act, when in fact it was a brutal suppression. It’s hardly surprising that we did the same thing to countries in Africa and Asia two-thousand years later. It’s time to let go of our roman inheritance and embrace our real heritage. »

## Concrete examples

Shelled legumes contribute to re-inject nitrogen in the soil by channelling it from the atmosphere through their leaves and passing it down in the earth through their roots by a symbiotic process with bacteria. This could be used as an alternative to chemical nitrogen fertilizers which are derived from natural gas and petrol and release a lot of green house gases in the process of their manufacture.

Native Americans have been using a technique called [the three sisters](https://www.nativeseeds.org/blogs/blog-news/how-to-grow-a-three-sisters-garden) in order to maintain the quality of the soil they use to grow food. It consisted of planting corn, squash and beans in alternating rows.

Preserving and nurturing biodiversity is another way to make communities more resilient to crop failures caused by bacterias, fungus, insects or viruses (see the great famine in Ireland). The more varieties are cultivated or growing in an area the more rich and complex the ecosystem will be. And the easiest way to encourage that biodiversity is to into the local soil and learn about the native species that grow well in it.

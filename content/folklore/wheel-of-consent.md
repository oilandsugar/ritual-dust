I wasn't really shown or thaught what consent is or can be as a kid, and as life went on, a lot of experiences (be it in a job or with working with clients as a freelance artist) reinforced this weird culture of not allowing yourself to have boundaries or practicing informed consent that is so rampant in our capitalistic society.

- our actions
- our body
- our mind
- our desires
- our safety
- our beliefs
- our feelings

Our limits define how much and for how long we're open to share from our domain with others.

a radical inquiry in the nature of receiving and giving, of consent and of knowing what you want.

## want to vs. willing to

want to is for something i want for my own reasons and that brings me some enjoyment.

willing to do is something i wouldn't do for my own reasons, but i'm willing to do because it's something that you want and brings you some enjoyment and i care for you. it's a gift.

There's degrees to each of these, from very enthusiastic to barely want to or not willing at all.

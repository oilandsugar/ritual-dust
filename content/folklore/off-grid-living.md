This is a very organic gathering of my notes and research on living off-grid, either in a home or in a vehicule (like a boat or a van). I have a dream of building a timber framed house in the woods at some points and to have a van or a boat setup for short-term living so these notes act as preparation, planning and inspiration for those projects.

### Power

The house and vehicule have quite different power needs, but in a perfect world they would both be powered by renewable energy. I'll detail here the system I started designing for a van.

_Van power needs total: 1784 Wh_

**Specs of the system**  
180Ah / 2160Wh 12v lithium battery  
200W of solar panels (monocrystalline, in parallel)  
2000W pure sine inverter  
40A charge controller

### Water

_Weekly water needs with shower and a sink: 25L_

### Fuel

I currently plan to use propane as fuel for a small stove in the van because of it's price and availability.
Propane tanks should always be stored outside or in a ventilated compartment for safety.

## Internet

Accessing the internet in a moving vehicule can be tricky, for the van I plan on minimizing our internet needs, using public and businesses wifi and data from our phones.

### Heating

Small wood stoves are really good at heating vans and boats, take into account storage space for wood, matches and fire extinguisher if getting a wood stove. Otherwise propane heaters are the cheapest and most efficient solution.

### Lighting

I would ideally use warm LED lights for most lighting needs, ideally with dimmers to accomodate our preferences at different moments in the day. In the van  I would use 12v bulbs and lights so they are easier to integrate with the electrical system.

### computers

For work, making music, and editing photos we use Mac laptops which would use up a good chunk of our power resources. In order to mitigate that I'm currently planning to build a small portable computer based on the RaspberyPi to use for simpler tasks, navigating the web, watching movies and listening to music.

### Shower

My plan for the van project is to have a shower in a cabinet. When closed it could be used as a work/cooking surface and when open a shower head and curtains could be put in place to transform it into a working shower. Showering in an off-grid vehicule is a luxury and uses a lot of water so I plan on using public showers if available, like in camping grounds and install a shower head that reduces the amount of water passing through it.

### Toilet

I'm thinking of getting or making a composting toilet for the van project, they almost doesn’t smell and with a urine diverter the compostable waste can be disposed of anywhere. In a small vehicule my plan is to combine the shower and toilet space to save space.

### Insurance

### Safety

- Locks for all doors
- Curtains for the windows
- CO2 and propane detectors
- access to all storage spaces from inside if needed
- Fire extinguisher
- First aid kit
- Hidden compartment for valuables

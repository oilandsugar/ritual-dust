October was a month of rest for me, I've been dealing with quite a lot of health and personal stuff. I broke a finger and manage to cut the ligament inside of it and I've been battling the health system of Quebec to get it treated properly ever since (it's in a much better place now). Apart from the color out of space print, the only other project i had the capacity to work on was the pre-production of  the next music video we're shooting in November for voidxwitch. That should be pretty fun and will be an opportunity for me to try shooting with a jib, pulling focus away from the camera and use an easy rig to make handheld shots easier. More details on that after the shoot ;)

I did manage to read, watch and listen to quite a bit of stuff, which has been a good change of things and has been inspiring me. Looking back at this month of October reminds me that creativity isn't only about output but operates more like breathing, from time to time we have to take some art in to feed our creative selves.

Spring is really setting in now, the trees are blooming, sleeping plants are shooting out of the earth and I feel very motivated and inspired by all this rebirth and sun energy coming in.

Here's a little recollection of the things I worked on during this last month. Some of which I wrote more in depth about here or will in the future as they progress.

### Earthworks album

I've been putting a lot of work on this lately, ever since figuring out the direction of this album and which songs should go on there. Over a couple years the songs that I pictured fitting on this first album shifted around quite a bit, I made some new ones, rediscovered old ones and played multiple iterations of a live set encompassing part of what became Earthworks.

If everything goes to plan I'll finish the last song in the coming weeks, get the album mixed and mastered and release it on the day of the summer solstice.

### Eternal logo

This is a commission piece for a friend on which I've been working on for a while. He's starting his own games consulting company and wanted something with darker and more experimental feel than most logos for these types of companies. I've tried a couple things until settling down on two custom typefaces intertwined together, one being inspired by black metal logos with a shaded treatment and then pixelated.

### Trailcam camera rig

In preparation for a music video we're planning for voidxwitch I've been modifying a trailcam to turn it into a versatile video / still camera that can shoot both color and infrared footage. So far I've figured out how to make the case smaller, how to power it with regular camera batteries and how to put it in a cage so i can attach more accessories to it. I'll keep working on this for the next couple months until we're ready to shoot.

### Low poly cursed town for voidxwitch

After completing the PS1 style avatar that I did for voidxwitch visuals we had the idea to make a whole little cursed town n which we could do different animations and scenes. We're channeling Silent Hill and Blair Witch quite a bit for that alongside real locations from Hex's past.

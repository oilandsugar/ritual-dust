September has been pretty much a continuation of August in terms of how fucked and chaotic my life has been. A lot of things are up n the air and uncertain now, I'm trying to hold on to the rest to weather the storm. We've also been raising money for our cat Callie in order to be able to afford the care she needs as she approaches the end of her life. 

### Props for Shadow over Innsmouth

The man project I was able to find energy for this month was the monthly print and two props to accompany it. For the postcard I revisited the photos I took when I traveled to Massachussets and Rhode Island on a Lovecraft themed adventure many years ago and found a suitable picture to illustrate the derelict town of Innsmouth.

In order to recreate the look of a lot of postcards from the 1920's that used a black and white photograph that was then colorized I desaturated the original photo and adjusted the contrast to get a good base and then recolorized it in photoshop with flat color shapes in slightly garish tones like they used to do.

The Esoteric Order of Dagon pamphlet was based on some research I did of old leaflets distributed by churches at the time, a good selection of fonts and the newsprint paper I've been using recently to add variation and a different feel to the paper I use for these props.

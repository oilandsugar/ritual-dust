I'm combining may and june because these two months have been mostly dedicated to re-centering, resourcing and figuring out some shit. Solstice was definitely a peak in energy and excitement as I released Earthworks. Most of my time and energy not spend on other things ended up directed to that project leading on to the release and I'm really of how the whole thing turned out, the album, visuals and videos.

Visuals for the Earthworks launch

That was an idea that I had a bit last minute when preparing my release, I though it would be cool to have the songs on youtube with some kind of visual matching each song for people to listen to the album there since i wasn't doing the whole distribution thing for that album. I had quite a bit of fun revisiting my ireland photos and combining them in trippy ways for that.

The whole playlist is over here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bRLcr2PHpw&list=PL01XwI4lbIITbFpQRVaRpOV7O9uiT-AfB

Nature photos from Lac Rouge

In may i had the pleasure of escaping the city to go spend a weekend beside a lake with my coworker from black circle, the tattoo studio I work at. It was really relaxing and grounding and i got to know better some of the great people i work with. It was also an opportunity to spend  lot of time really close and connected with nature, with the carnivorous plants growing on logs on the low parts of the lake, with golden eagles flying close to us while approaching a clearing in a swamp, with tons of green frogs, bull frogs and spring peepers. I took some photos of the whole thing which you can see here: https://ritualdust.com/works/photo/frogs-carnivorous-plants/

I also recorded a choir of frogs at night with my field recording setup and I'm pretty excited to use that in a song :)

Videos and photos for voidxwitch

Beside all that, me and Hex are still grinding at the new Voidxwitch album and doing some short form video and photo stuff for promotion as we slowly prepare for the first single release. We bought a huge 50k lumen flashlight second hand for those and damn, it's so much fun, and creates the most eerie images. We got the inpiration for that from https://www.instagram.com/briscoepark/ and also from needing a strong light but not having the money to get a big cinema light. We got some photos we took with it coming up, otherwise you can see some of the short videos i filmed (including one shot with our modified trailcam) over here in the shorts section: https://www.youtube.com/@voidxwitch

That's about it for now, I hope you're all doing great, I'm really looking forward to my album launch party on the 27th and to have the time / headspace to draw more :)

## Recognition

### Teaching

- I've worked as an art school technician, building woodworking shops, teaching woodworking, animation, 3D modelling, playing with 3D printers and helping students realize their creative ideas no matter what medium they required.
- Taught branding to upcoming jewellers at l'École de Joaillerie de Montréal
- I was teacher's assistant in a printmaking class at UQAM

### Other work experience

My past work experience includes working as a UI/UX and graphic designer in startups such as FoodRelay, Tangea, and l'Institut du Leadership en e-learning.

### Education

- BFA at UQAM (Canada), focussing primarily on print (from screen printing to lithography) and the intersection of design, writing and art to explore themes of identity, gender and politics.

Software tools for me are mostly a mean to an end, although I do enjoy building them if I have a specific problem and nothing is available that I find simple and efficient enough for the task. I'm currently migrating away from proprietary tools towards open source tools compatible with a wider range of OSes and that could run on my [resilient computer](/craft/resilient-computer/). If you ever know of good tools that could replace some of the ones I'm using right now feel free to let me know!

- Gimp for photo editing

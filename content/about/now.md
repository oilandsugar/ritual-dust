These days I'm [drawing](/works/illustration/) a lot, working on this very [website](), putting together a collaborative ghost story and images zine named [Fant√¥mes](https://fantomeszine.com), learning how to tattoo and building a [tool chest](/craft/tool-chest/) for my hand woodworking tools.
I also make truly devastating and highly emotional music as [Blood and Dust](http://blood-and-dust.com) with [Hayley Evans](http://hayleyevans.net).

See what I'm currently [reading](/about/reading/), [watching](/about/watching/) and [listening to](/about/listening/).

These days I'm learning to [tattoo](/tattoo), working on setting up a patreon page, painting a dungeon synth album cover and working on an album inspired by megalithic circles, old folklore and the BBC radiophonic workshop sonic experiments. I'm also looking for stockists for my [collaborative ghost story zine Fant√¥mes](https://fantomeszine.com).

See what I'm currently [reading](/about/reading/), [watching](/about/watching/), [playing](/about/playing/) and [listening to](/about/listening/).

These days I'm [drawing](/works/illustration/), designing [dungeon synth album covers](/works/design/dungeon-synth-covers/), just release the first issue of my [collaborative ghost story zine Fant√¥mes](https://fantomeszine.com), learning how to tattoo and play piano. I also released a [new single](https://blood-and-dust.bandcamp.com/track/around-your-grave-ill-light-a-ring-of-fire) with my band [Blood and Dust](http://blood-and-dust.com).

See what I'm currently [reading](/about/reading/), [watching](/about/watching/) and [listening to](/about/listening/).

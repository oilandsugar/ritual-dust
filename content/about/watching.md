2023: We went through a phase of 2000s horror movies and watched all of the Blair Witch movies, really enjoying going through all the seasons of Buffy and saw a couple of great new movies.

2022: Got a better pace of watching movies in 2022, went through an aliens and predator phase and was pleased to see all the good new movies that came out.

2021: I watched quite a bit of folk-horror movies in 2021 and the best documentary on the genre Ive seen so far, 2 movies Starring Nicholas Cage, some great TV movie adaptations of M.R. James ghost stories, my favourites are highlighted in the list below.

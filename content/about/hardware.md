## Photo and video

I have often bought photo and video gear for specific projects or to explore new ways of making images. A lot of my choices were informed by my budget at the time too, there's always a better tool but finding the one you can afford that you can learn to use in the most creative way is more important at the end of the day I think.

### Photo camera

- **Sony A6300**  
- **Smallrig cage**  
- **Cheap Sony to Canon mount adapter**

### Lenses

- **Canon EFS 24mm f2.8** with HOYA filter for protection  
- **Rokinon 10mm f2.8**

### Tripods

- **Photopro X-4CN carbon fiber tripod**
- **Davis & Stanford video tripod** on wheels

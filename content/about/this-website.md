### The why

This website is part [portfolio](/works/), part [digital garden](/folklore/) and part [recipe blog](/food/). It is where I collect and expand upon my thoughts and discoveries, and where I showcase what I create, craft and conjure.

### Fonts

When selecting fonts for this website, I was looking to combine my love for 70's psychedelia and gothic blackletter while keeping everything mostly legible and accessible.

Fonts used on this website:  
**Medieval pixel** for the larger titles
**Wittenberger** is used for blackletter titles  
**Cooper Std** is used for the second level of titles  
**Distro** is used for the third level of titles  
**Wrenema** is used for body text

If you're into cool fonts look up [this directory of open source fonts by womxn](https://www.design-research.be/by-womxn/), this [crazy foundry making free fonts](https://www.velvetyne.fr/), this [directory of free to use and free to modify fonts](http://usemodify.com/) and the [download foundry](https://fonderie.download/) making really experimental stuff. Last thing, here's a [cool site with all the unicode characters handy](https://unilist.raphaelbastide.com/).

### Color theme

This website changes color theme every season. For doing so I'm using a theming system based on the one built by [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com/) in their older JS apps, [see the code and find other themes here](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes). It uses an svg file to store the color values. By default, the first time you load the website it will apply this season's theme, but you can also change it by dragging and dropping a theme svg file onto it. Once you do so, it will save your preferred theme in local storage so you'll see it when you visit again. Also note that these themes are compatible with the older hundred rabbits apps like [Left](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Left), [Orca](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) or [Dotgrid](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Dotgrid) feel free to use them for that too!

Here are the themes I've made so far

### Images

By default it loads low resolution dithered images (generated with [Ditherit.com](https://ditherit.com/)) to reduce the loading time and the bandwidth needed to view the website. A toggle on the top right allows to switch to high resolution images. This feature was based upon Nate Steiner's [imageswap](https://tendigits.space/site/imageswap.html).

### Technology

This website is basically a collection of html files in folders, generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It does not require javascript to run. The files are hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and the domain on [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en).

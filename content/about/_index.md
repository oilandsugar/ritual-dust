My past work experience includes working as a UI/UX and graphic designer in startups such as FoodRelay, Tangea, and l'Institut du Leadership en e-learning.

I have studied visual and media arts at UQAM, focussing primarily on print (from screen printing to lithography) and the intersection of design, writing and art to explore themes of identity, gender and politics.

I am part of the Montréal interactive community and I've done [talks](/about/talks/) and shared my process at some of their events.

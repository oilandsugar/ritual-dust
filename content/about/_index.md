I am Lizbeth Poirier, a designer and illustrator, goth druid, musician and craftsperson.

My pronouns are **she/her**.

![Lizbeth against a rock background](/img/about/me.jpg "Portrait by Hex")

I am currently taking commission work for [design](/works/design/), [illustration](/works/illustration/), [lettering](/works/lettering/) and [web](/works/websites/) projects (especially anything relating to folklore, occultism, activism music and art).

I am also [crafting ritual tools](/craft/) and small handcrafted wooden items.

To discuss those, email me at: lizbeth.poirier.m@gmail.com

This website is part [portfolio](/works/), part [digital garden](/folklore/) and part [recipe blog](/food/). It is where I collect and expand upon my thoughts and discoveries, and where I showcase what I create, craft and conjure.

Read more on how it was made in the [Colophon](/about/colophon/).

My past work experience includes working as a UI/UX and graphic designer in startups such as FoodRelay, Tangea, and l'Institut du Leadership en e-learning.

I've worked as an art school technician, building woodworking shops, teaching woodworking, animation, 3D modelling, playing with 3D printers and helping students realize their creative ideas no matter what medium they required.

I have studied visual and media arts at UQAM, focussing primarily on print (from screen printing to lithography) and the intersection of design, writing and art to explore themes of identity, gender and politics.

I am part of the Montr√©al interactive community and I've done [talks](/about/talks/) and shared my process at some of their events.

Design for the cassette release of Förgjorninger by [Girl Circles](https://girlcircles.bandcamp.com)

The J-card is a small poster folded which on one side shows a photo we took of the result of the recreation of an old heathen curse, and on the other side has the written instructions of the said curse, printed, cut up and scanned again like an old zine. The rest of the J-card is filled with film photographs taken by the artist to accompany the music.

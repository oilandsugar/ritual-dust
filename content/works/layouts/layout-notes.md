## Document setup

### Document size

my standard for zines is: 

### Binding 

### Margins and bleed

### Typography

- columns
- baseline grid

## Creating templates


layers:
- text
- art
- bg

use paragraph styles for most things
- toggle style override highlighter to see all the text that doesn't just have a paragrah style to clean up things

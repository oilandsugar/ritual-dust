The greatest trick the devil could ever pull is convincing the world he exists.

reclaiming satanic imagery and symbolism, something that was used by the catholic church and conservatives to feed fear and judgement and making something more positive out of it

using these visuals not as empty shock tactics but as a way to encourage people to ask themselves questions, juxtaposing and superposing text, voice and images to  ask those questions, maybe even let the christians ask the questions themselves by quoting the original texts in a different context

Be careful not to validate the position of the church by positioning satanism only as an enemy / danger of the church

Instead work on amplifying the stuff that the church is trying to silence

there is no devil other than the one man creates

altering and creating memories is still as problematic than it was back then

In Michelle remembers, a lot of effort is put on trying to prove the real and material existence of satan, marks on the skin, doctor appointments, scans, photographs, video. But little is done to do the same for Jesus, Mary and Michael who appears in a similar fashion. Even though these figures of light are just the other side of the same fictional coin.
A mythology based on this moral dichotomy of good and evil, so often used to discriminate and breed fear.

The idea of the ‚Äúother‚Äù the ones who are not like us, who do blasphemous things, unnatural things. Who do not follow the right path (notice the absence of a multitude of paths).

Creating a sense of belonging and community by collectively excluding different people, instead of focusing on what is shared and being opened to differences

The inversion of catholic symbolism and rites associated with satanism doesn‚Äôt make any sense for any kind of real organized cult. It presupposes that it depends entirely on christian ways and images to exist and that over time it never developed it‚Äôs own cultural symbols.

Let‚Äôs develop a new satanic symbolism, liberated from the idea of simply doing the opposite the church of god does. Because doing so also means that everything the catholic church is either right or wrong

The more people believe in a pure evil (namely the existence of satan), the more they are prone to develop antisocial and agressive behaviour towards perceived wrong-doers

Folk horror:

the fear of something ancient that should have been long gone / forgotten

ancient vs modern
Conservative and close minded vs progressive and inclusive

ritualistic and symbolic aspects and cults
fear of folk / people, the evil is human and not supernatural
there is a fear of belonging to these common people that develops as we realize that the horror lives inside of the normal people

the more we try to make the environment belong, the more we feel the ostracization
belonging at odds with modernity

Blasphemy

greek root blasphem-
Used 55 times in the new testament

Translators choose "blaspheme" when, for instance, the verbs "curse" (qalal), "revile" (gadap) or "despise" (herep) are used with God as the object. No special verb is reserved for insults directed at God.

Blasphemy is well-attested in the Old Testament in passages like Leviticus 24:10-16, which were rooted in the fundamental command of Exodus 22:28 that states, ‚ÄúYou shall not revile God, nor curse a ruler of your people.‚Äù Such blasphemy was subject to punishment by death. For, to revile God (or those whom he appointed) was to call into question the integrity and holiness of God himself.

Blasphemous acts:

- Idolatry
- Arrogance
- Blasphemy against the holy spirit:
‚ÄúIt is to finally reject the Holy Spirit‚Äôs testimony to Jesus‚Äô identity and mission. It is to deny that Jesus is who the Holy Spirit has revealed Him to be. It is to behold the person and work of Christ as empowered by the Holy Spirit and reject it outright! It is to revile God himself!‚Äù

Sacrilege

Person - places - things
Physical sacrilege = desecration

Sacrileges:

- sins against the vow of chastity
- Theft of something found or belonging in a church
- Performing sinful acts in a sacred place
- Irreverence against the holy eucharist
- Maltreatment of sacred pictures
- Perversion of holy scripture or sacred vessels to unhallowed uses

‚ÄúThat if any person shall break and enter any church or chapel, and steal therein any chattel, or having stolen any chattel in any church or chapel, shall break out of the same, every such offender, being convicted thereof, shall suffer death as a felon.‚Äù

In england and wales

Profanation / desecration
Desecration is the act of depriving something of its sacred character, or the disrespectful, contemptuous, or destructive treatment of that which is held to be sacred or holy by a group or individual.

"for that all superstition of pagans and heathens should be annihilated is what God wants, God commands, God proclaims!"

Michelle Remembers

‚ÄúBlasphemy isn‚Äôt just directed at other people to offend them Blasphemy is very much a declaration of personal independence‚Äù

Satanic panic was projection

¬´¬†To say that satanism is anti-christian is a half-truth, they anti-christian in the sense that they are post-christian, they actually left christianity and they‚Äôre taking satan with them¬†¬ª

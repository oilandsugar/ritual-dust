But "art" is not art. "Art" is politics that has created new styles of communication.

I don’t smoke for the same reason other do, because of habit.
I am not used to laughing anymore and my facial muscles would hurt if i would try it again.
The pebble at the bottom of the sea is wounded by your shadow.
To leave the district of security.
To burn the dryness of the vagina.
To pursue the harshness of power.
To deprive the animal of it’s fight.
Words tear at the shores of my mouth.
The desire of my mouth burst at the close of it’s opening.
Recommendations as condemnations.
I can’t progress, nor do i regress i only step aside.
My eyes are like nuts where all sadness is hidden.
Shrapnels of feeble imagination.
I hit a key and the sound of bitter irony arises.
Music.
I hit a second key and something of willpower ascends.
The movement of the arm reaches not only to the shores.
It is not enough to put your hands on the table, to set your feet on the stairs and to count time in hours and desires.

Illustration inspired by the story [Shadow over Innsmouth](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/fiction/soi.aspx) by H.P. Lovecraft, the third piece in a series of Lovecraftian scenes. I just love the shunned and decrepit town of Innsmouth with it's strange and fishy inhabitants, secret cult to Dagon and ominous reef looming a short distance from the coast. For this illustration I depicted one of the inhabitants in the final stages of their transformation, now well beyond the rumoured "Innsmouth look".

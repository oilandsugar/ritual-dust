Pencil illustration done as an offering for no kings day.

May this day be a reminder to all that we will not tolerate any king, old or new, dictating and controlling the people, the land and all living things. Every day I see more people waking up, standing up and fighting back, from the streets of countless cities and towns on turtle island, aboard boats and convoys headed to Gaza, in the forests of my own province where the indigenous elders are shutting down illegal logging. Every little bit helps grind down the empire and its machines.

On the stone is a crow with its wings open and in from of the stone is a maga hat with a celtic sword stabbed through it. hanging from the guard of the sword is a string with tesla logos torn from cars that have been destroyed.](/img/illustration/no-kings/no-kings.jpg "Pencil illustration on a green background with no kings repeated as a background motif.

Illustration inspired by the story [The Color out of Space](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cs.aspx) by H.P. Lovecraft, the fourth in a series of Lovecraftian scenes. This story has always been a favorite of mine and one of the best depiction of an alien life-form that doesn't follow any of the rules of life on earth. The story also evokes really well the effects of what could be some kind of radiation exposure as it mutates and decays everything surrounding the source of the color.

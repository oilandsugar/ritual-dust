In collaboration with my friend Steven, I'm illustrating a [series of TTRPG weapons](/works/design/weapon-compendium/) from a fantasy world we're creating called *Pious Rot*. Every weapon has some lore and stats attached to it which informs the illustration I make for it. We're also making these following different parts of the fantasy world and I try to create a sense of local culture and craft between them. We're making a new one every week for the time being until we're done with all the regions of the world.

The illustration are made with graphite and ink, I'm also considering adding colour to all the weapons of a region once we're done with it.

Illustration inspired by the Dunwich Horror by H.P. Lovecraft. This piece was the first I drew in an ongoing series of scenes from Lovecraft novels. I was drawn to this one because of it's folk-horror elements and the rural setting. I had fun integrating sigils referring to the occult litterature used by the Wheatleys to conjure cosmic horrors.

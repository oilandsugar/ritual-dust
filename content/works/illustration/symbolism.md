## Overview and themes

Symbolism was an art movement from the late 19th century of French, Russian and Belgian origins. Literature, myth religion and poetry are it's main sources of inspiration material, with artists drawing from old mythology, medieval poetry and more modern pieces like *Les Fleurs du Mal* from Charles Baudelaire as inspiration for visual pieces.

One key aspect of symbolic works of art is their detachment from direct representation of things that exist but instead try to convey emotions, dreams and ideas through the use of symbols and codified visual language.

### An introduction to the genre

It's quite hard to pin down the start of the genre of fantasy art, one could argue that it is more than a genre and more a amalagm of themes and illustrative styles. If we see it like that it goes back centuries and overlaps quite a lot with folk art which often depicted mythological characters and fantastic creatures almost as far back as human made images. But what's generally seen or described as fantasy art was popularized during the 20th century, often through illustrations for books, magazines, games and movies. In this page, I'll go through some of the artists of the genre that inspire me and explore how the genre manifested itself alongside the different types of media it illustrated. This is in no way exhaustive or trying to be an history of the genre or an academic study of it, it's a collection of illustrations that inspire me in their context for further reference.

#### Magazine and publications about games

In addition to the game themselves, a panoply of magazines covering the subject of these role-playing / wargaming / card games in depth, providing extra campaign materials, tips on the hobby or complementary lore (along with a fair amount of ads). They often featured elaborate and painterly covers along with some black and white illustrations on the inside.

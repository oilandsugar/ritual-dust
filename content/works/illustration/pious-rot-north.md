In collaboration with my friend Sedge, I'm illustrating a TTRPG fantasy setting called [Pious Rot](https://piousrot.com/). It takes inspiration from bronze and iron age europe with plenty of fantastical elements, creatures and myths. I'm illustrating the different areas as we create them and the North is the first one we got to a complete enough level to share. 

Most of the illustrations are drawn in graphite and some in ink, and colorized digitally.

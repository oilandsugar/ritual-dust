## Album covers

I can do album covers in pencil, as an acrylic painting or with processed photography. In all cases, we'll discuss the concept of the album, its themes, and how they should be represented visually. From there, if we go with illustration or painting I'll do sketches, a round of adjustments and complete the final piece. Please note that I only do things that fit my illustration style ([see here for reference](/works/illustration/)). For photography-based covers, I'll see if I have something that would work in my current collection or research something from the public domain that I could rework, make a round of adjustments and editing and then finalize the file.

The prices can vary more for this kind of project depending on the complexity and the resources needed to complete it, once we have discussed about it more I'll be able to give you a quote. The files I send you when it is done is a high-quality scan of the drawing or painting large enough to be printed on a vinyl sleeve, if you’re interested in owning the original piece we could discuss that at that point.

Please note that these prices are only for the artwork itself and not for the layout and typography, I can also do that either for a digital release (adding the name of the album and the band) or for a physical release with a full sleeve designs and possibly complementary illustrations.

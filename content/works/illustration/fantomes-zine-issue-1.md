[Fantômes](https://fantomeszine.com/) was my first zine project, one that started very small when I realized that I could regroup in a zine my obsession with ghosts, the drawings I made of them and the photos of ghostly places I took. Then I asked around to see if other people would be interested in creating or writing pieces about ghosts, and got an incredible response. I then spent the next 6 months collecting, assembling, laying out and illustrating all that material to form what became the first issue of this little zine. This project regroups all of the drawings I made for the zine, from my personal standalone pieces to the more illustrative page frames and fillers to accompany the different stories and written pieces.

Illustration inspired by the story [At the Mountains of Madness](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/fiction/mm.aspx) by H.P. Lovecraft, the second in the series of Lovecraftian scenes. This is one of my favorite Lovecraft novels, I've always been a fan of cursed expedition stories and this is the pinnacle of it. It brings you right in the eerie and alien frozen world that is Antarctica and slowly reveals more and more terrifying secrets buried there. The main subject of this scene is an *Elder Thing*, one of the exceedingly strange creatures found by the scientists in the story. It was a pleasure to do my own rendition of it based on the writings and sketches of Lovecraft.

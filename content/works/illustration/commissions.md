## Album covers

For album covers I can do pencil drawing, painting or photography. In both cases, we'll discuss the concept of the album, it's themes and how it should be represented visually. From there, if we go with illustration or painting I'll do sketches, a round of adjustments and complete the final piece. Please note that I only do things that fit my illustration style. For photography-based covers, I'll sketch some ideas or see if I have something that would work in my current collection or research something from the public domain that i would rework, make a round of adjustments and editing and then finalize the file.

The prices can vary more for this kind of project depending on the complexity and the resources needed to complete it, once we have discussed about it more I'll be able to give you a quote. The files I send you when it is done is a high-quality scan of the drawing or painting large enough to be printed on a vinyl sleeve, if you’re interested in owning the original piece we could discuss that at that point.

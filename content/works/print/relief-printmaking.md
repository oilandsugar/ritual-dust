## The principle

Relief printing is a way to make multiple copies of an images using a block or plate that is carved, inked and then run through a press to transfer the image onto a piece of paper. It works in a similar way to a stamp in that the image will be reversed once printed and only the raised parts of the block will print, the lines and shapes that were carved leaving the white of the paper.

This technique is really old and goes back to around 500BC with Egyptians using it to print on fabric and later on seals carved out of stone by ancient Chinese people. It has been used to illustrate books for a good chunk of history before photolithographic processes replaced it.

## The carving process

### Preparing the block

Painting the block black before starting to carve it helps see what the positive and negative image will end up looking like because the carved parts will show the lighter underlying material.

Tip: when working with lino, heat it up with a blow dryer to make it easier to cut.

### The tools

Gouges are used

### Carving the block

Carve it up

## Printing process

### Paper

Preparing paper by tearing to size

### Ink

Usually most prints are made with oil-based inks but water based inks are becoming more common

### Pressure source

>"But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to be expunged; this I shall do by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."
<small>- William Blake</small>

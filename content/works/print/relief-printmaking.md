## The principle

Relief printing is a way to make multiple copies of an images using a block or plate that is carved, inked and then run through a press to transfer the image onto a piece of paper. It works in a similar way to a stamp in that the image will be reversed once printed and only the raised parts of the block will print, the lines and shapes that were carved leaving the white of the paper.

This technique is really old and goes back to around 500BC with Egyptians using it to print on fabric and later on seals carved out of stone by ancient Chinese people. It has been used to illustrate books for a good chunk of history before photolithographic processes replaced it.

## The carving process

### Preparing the block

The first step is preparing the block (wood or linoleum in this case) into which you'll be carving your image.

Painting the block black before starting to carve it helps see what the positive and negative image will end up looking like because the carved parts will show the lighter underlying material.

Tip: when working with lino, heat it up with a blow dryer to make it easier to cut.

### Carving the block

## The Printing process

### Paper

Picking the right paper and it's size for the block is an important part of the process. Personally I prefer working with heavier cotton fibre papers since they take ink really well, tend to show some embossing and make beautiful objects once printed. Thinner Japanese *washi* paper can also be used, it lends itself well to the hand-rubbed printing method since they are so thin and allow to see the progress on the back. Cartouche or newsprint is commonly used for proofing a print (making test impressions to see the progress of the plate).

### Registration

leave more room at the bottom than the top

### Ink

Usually most prints are made with oil-based inks but water based inks are becoming more common, I've only worked with oil-based ink so far when doing that type of printing so I can only advise on those.

For inking your plate you'll need a roller, a spatula, and an inking surface (something very flat and non-porous like a plate of glass or a tile).

When your paper and registration guide is ready, take some ink with your spatula and spread it out in a line on your inking surface, it is usually good to move it around to warm it up a little bit and to make sure it doesn't contain dried particles that will affect the quality of the print.

### Pressure source

Relief prints can be printed using one of two methods, either by hand-rubbing the back of the paper that has been applied on top of the ink block with a tool, or by using a printing press.

Hand-rubbing is a good way to get started and can yield great results, especially for small editions. European woodcuts were printed mostly with a printing press historically but in japan, woodblock printing is done with a tool called a *baren*. Other less specialized tools that can be used are: a bone folder, a wooden or metal spoon, a metal tin, etc. Really what you're looking for is a hard and soft surface with a medium-sized point of contact with the paper - too small and it makes it tedious to cover the whole surface, too big and it requires too much pressure to print correctly.

>"But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to be expunged; this I shall do by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid."

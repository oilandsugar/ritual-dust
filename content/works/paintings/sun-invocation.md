On winter solstice of this year 2021, I had the feeling that I should take painting back again, after more than 10 years. For a year now I've been going on personal and artistic journeys on the solstices and equinoxes, looking for insights and inspiration. It started with a walk through the neighbouring park, feeling the cold wind on my face and absorbed by the bright setting sun.

I knew the sun and warmth would come back but I also knew that dark, cold and lonely days and months were coming, especially with the plague looming over the city. I made an offering to the sun god that day, and asked in return if I could carry a single flame of it's fire for the coming months. This painting is that flame, captured in paint on wood, enshrined in a sigil.

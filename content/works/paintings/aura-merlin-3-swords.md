Painting for the cover of the first album ["Three Swords"](https://auramerlin.bandcamp.com/album/3-swords) of the local dungeon synth project [Aura Merlin](https://auramerlin.bandcamp.com/). The concept for the album was a lonely wanderer making their way to this cave in the woods in a quest to find three magical swords.

"Attack, threaten or defend  
A gift, three swords, one choice  
A passage to transcend  
Through a smoky cavern, a voice.."

I was inspired by Russian landscape painters from the turn of the century for the colors and ruggedness of the trees in these kinds of snow-covered landscapes. The painting was made with acrylics on heavy paper.

I also made a [logo for Aura Merlin](/works/lettering/aura-merlin/) which features on this cover and a layout for a cassette release of the album.

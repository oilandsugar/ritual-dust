Painting for the cover of the second album ["Illuminations"](https://auramerlin.bandcamp.com/album/illuminations) of the local dungeon synth project [Aura Merlin](https://auramerlin.bandcamp.com/). This second album has more of a new age, melodic ambient vibe with still some solid dungeon synth roots. It's perfect for daydreaming or pondering the deep knowledge hidden in old illuminated medieval tomes.

The arwork for it was inspired by medieval manuscripts and the illuminations that embellishes their handwritten pages. I did quite a bit of reasearch on the iconography, the colors and the gilding techniques used back in the day to make something that felt authentic.

The artwork was also turned into a full design for a cassette release by Ancient Kings.

Painting for the cover of the third [Aura Merlin](https://auramerlin.bandcamp.com/) album, ["Moon Gates"](https://auramerlin.bandcamp.com/album/moon-gates).

I also did some illustrations for this album which you can see here: [Moon Gates Illustrations](/works/illustration/moon-gates/).

This painting reference 90's fantasy art and new age visuals quite a bit, and expands upon the visual world that I've been building for Aura Merlin since her first album.

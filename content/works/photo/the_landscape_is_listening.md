Walking the urban Landscape of Montreal and noticing it's nature, patterns and textures. Getting lost in the fragmented forest that lives beneath the city.

These photos were taken in the context of the workshop of the same name organized by Lily Hayes & George Saralis-Wheatley, more info can be found here: https://thelandscapeislistening.cargo.site/

The good folks at [Hellebore zine](https://helleborezine.bigcartel.com/) tasked me and Hex to make the cover image for their impromptu [Yuletide edition](https://helleborezine.bigcartel.com/product/hellebore4). The theme was the celtic horned god, Cernunnos. With our interpretation of Cernunnos, we wanted to explore the darker aspects of the natural cycle while subverting the gender binary that is often attached to this ancient pagan divinity, channeling Cernunnos within a social and natural context that embraces nuance, complexity, and change. The final cover treatment and design was made by [Nathaniel Winter-HÃ©bert](http://winterhebert.com/).

Dead leaves buried by snow, dark and empty branches reaching for the sky like the horns of a great beast. A cold hand holding strongly onto the flame of life, leading us through these winter months of darkness and decay.

I've also crafted the headpiece for this photo out of leather and sticks, I'll post about it on here at a later time.

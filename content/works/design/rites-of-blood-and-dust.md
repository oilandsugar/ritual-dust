Album cover and cassette sleeve design for the first Blood and Dust release.
The texture used as a background to the design was photographed indoors from soil, leaves and branches collected outside and with the addition of a good amount of fake blood. The concept for this album design, especially the cassette version was to make a physical vessel to contain the music, like an ancient cursed object holding the intense emotions and energy channelled in the songs. The cassette sleeves were cut, punched and folded by hand and all cassettes were engraved with our two sigils.

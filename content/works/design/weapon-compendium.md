Together with my friend Steven, we're building a fictional fantasy world called *Pious Rot*, we started with some of the legendary weapons and their lore and we'll keep going from there. I'm putting together these pages for each weapon like if they were part of a full book (hopefully we get to actually make the book one day) with all the stats, the story and the [illustrations](/works/illustration/weapon-compendium/).

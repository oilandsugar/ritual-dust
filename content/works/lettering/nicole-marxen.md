Hand-drawn band logo for the solo project of [Nicole Marxen](https://nicolemarxen.bandcamp.com/album/tether), a mix of avant-garde pop, synthwave and experimental rock. Her first album is a meditation on grief and the painful and messy process of going through these feelings, in her own words: "I often compare the experience to uncovering a crystal, digging through foundation to discover something both jagged and brilliantly beautiful."

Woodcut style occult inspired logo for Sworn to Darkness

![Sworn to darkness logo and symbol](/img/lettering/sworn-to-darkness/logo.jpg "Sworn to darkness logo and symbol")

In order to get a realistic woodcut style I made a linocut of the symbol first to guide the drawing of the letters, here are some photos of this process:

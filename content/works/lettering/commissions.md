## Band / Project logo

I have quite a bit of experience doing lettering work and logos for bands of a good range of genres but mostly black metal, doom, dungeon synth, noise and experimental music.

When you commission me a logo, the first step is talking a bit more with you about what you’re envisioning and getting any inspirations that you like as a reference point (you can also just give me wildcard and I’ll work from the music and the name itself). Once I have this I'll do some sketches and send them to you. We can then do a round of adjustments on these sketches if needed and then I complete the final logo from the selected sketch.

Price-wise, I work with a sliding scale based on your financial situation, the three prices matching with the three levels of the sliding scale. Note that these prices are a guideline, depending on the specifics of the project, the planned usage, the amount of work and detail these can vary.

### Hand-drawn text logo + symbol + extra small illustrations
500$ / 425$ / 375$ cad

The biggest package, including logo, symbol and extra small illustrations. This is really useful if you plan on making merch or for making a more complete album sleeve.

I ask for half of the price before starting work and the other half upon reception of the final files. These prices includes hi-res files in black and white with transparent background (I can also include one in color in there if needed).

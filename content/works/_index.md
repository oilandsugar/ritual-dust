I am a multidisciplinary folk and fantasy artist interested in the transmission and creation of folklore, the magic of the land, and ancestral and communal knowledge. I also work as an illustrator, designer and lettering artist doing commission work for clients (musicians, game designers, authors and publishers, etc.).   

If you want to hire me to work on a project for you, give a look to my [commissions page](/works/commissions).

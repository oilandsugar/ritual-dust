I run a monthly print club on patreon through which you can send me a monthly donation of 45$ cad and in exchange receive an art print (sometimes accompanied by extra paraphernalia) from me every month in the mail. Every subscription helps me dedicate more time to my art.

## How does it work?

Once you join the print club on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ritualdust), you'll get access to my posts on there. Every month I post some progress pictures of the upcoming print. At the end of the month or a bit later, once the print is finished, I print and ship them to all the people subscribed to my Occult Correspondence tier.

Prints are usually 8" x 10" in terms of dimensions, printed on heavy acid-free paper and packaged in a plastic-free protective sleeve with a backing board to make sure it gets safely to you.

The prints are shipped as letter mail without tracking. International shipping can be pretty slow so please be patient if you are not located in canada.

## Can I buy a past print?

All the prints of the previous months are available to purchase on my [shop](/shop/). Sometimes the color tint will vary (like for my lovecraft inspired series) or the extra paraphernalia are not available, but all the print themselves are made available at full price once the corresponding month is passed.

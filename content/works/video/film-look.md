simulating super 16 with a digital camera:

- 24 fps
- 1/48 or 1/50 shutter speed
- picture settings -> sharpness to lower setting
- f2.8 minimum

when editing the footage, make these changes:

- add grain
- lift midtones
- make sure shadows are not totally black
- bring highlights towards magenta
- bring midtones towards green / yellow
- add a flicker layer with overlay blend mode
- add a slight vignette

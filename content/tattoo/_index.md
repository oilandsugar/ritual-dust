I'm currently apprenticing the art and craft of tattooing at [Black Circle](https://www.instagram.com/blackcircle_montreal/) in Montreal. I work in three styles, a dark fantasy illustrative style inspired by my pencil drawings, a medieval woodcut style rooted in my printmaking work and a black metal lettering style that comes from my years of making band logos. I like to do custom work that falls into one of these categories and I also always have plenty of flash available to book.

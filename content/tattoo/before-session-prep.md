## The week before

Drink plenty of water and stay hydrated, this will help your skin be in better condition for tattooing and heal better.
Moisturize your skin regularly to keep it in its optimal condition.

Get a good night's sleep before your session, eat well and avoid alcohol and drugs so you're well rested for your tattoo. The pain is usually lower if you're not tired or hungry.

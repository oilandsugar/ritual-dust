This page is a living document which contains the approaches and techniques I know of for sustainable and resilient home building and restoration, and some considerations and knowledge about the process from finding a good location, securing permits needed, construction and maintenance.

To go along with this note, I made [another one specifically on off-grid living](/craft/off-grid-living/), either in a boat, van or small home.

## Philosophy

Sustainable and resilient are two pretty general terms that can mean a lot of things, especially in the context of building, construction and restoration. My specific approach is focussed on reducing the need for new materials, building for longevity and making sure the house adapts to the realities of the current climate crisis in the context of the region where it is built. Additionally, other considerations I keep in mind for building a home are: how it fits the needs of it's inhabitants, how cozy and comfortable it is, how good it looks.

## Location

Choosing a good location to build is as important as what and how you're building it. The location defines how easy it will be to access, how much sunlight the house will have depending on the different seasons, how the rainwater will be diverted from it's flat surfaces and directed into the ground and how safe the house is.

Flooding, forest fires

Access to site, right of way, community

Orientation with the sun

## Services

Services refer to the amenities that a modern house usually have access too, **sewage disposal**, **running water**, **heating** and **electricity**. These can be provided by a municipal grid, or off-grid alternatives for example a septic tank or composting system for sewage, a well for water, a wood stove for heating and solar power for electricity.

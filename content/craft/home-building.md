## Philosophy

Sustainable and resilient are two pretty general terms that can mean a lot of things, especially in the context of building and construction.

## Location

Choosing a good location to build is as important as what and how you're building it.

## Materials

What makes materials good for this kind of building: local availability, ease of repair / replacement, durability.

## Timber framing terminology

### Beam types

- **Post**: Vertical beam
- **Girt**: horizontal beam supported by the post, going along the width of the building
- **Plate**: horizontal beam supported by the posts, going along the length of the structure
- **Wall plate**: plate at the base of a roof
- **Ridge plate**: plate at the top of a roof
- **Knee-brace**: angled piece strengthening corner joints
- **King post**:
- **Rafter**: Smaller beam supporting the roof
- **Floor joist**: smaller beam supporting the floor planks

### Joinery

- **Mortise**: Hole cut through a beam made to receive a tenon in order to create a joint
 - **Through-mortise**: mortise cut through the whole beam, often to allow joining a beam on each side of a post
 - **Hunched-tenon**:
- **Pocket**: Hole cut to accomodate a full beam inset in another one.
- **Tenon**:
- **Bird's mouth**: joint between rafters and plates holding them in place vertically

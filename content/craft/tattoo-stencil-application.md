### Step 1: Find design size

<div class="checklist">

- [ ] Print the design in black and white in a size that seems good for the placement
- [ ] Cut around the printed design and try it on the body of the client, making sure the size is good
- [ ] If needed, resize with the printer, print again and double check the new size

</div>

### Step 2: Copy stencil

<div class="checklist">

- [ ] Once the good size was found, tape the design on a blank sheet of paper, leaving some room at the bottom
- [ ] Get a sheet of stencil paper and remove the tissue paper barrier
- [ ] Place the stencil paper in the machine
- [ ] Place the sheet with the design in the machine
- [ ] Press copy and hold the stencil paper with both hands slowly pulling on it while it copies the design
- [ ] Once the copy is done cut around the stencil and place it onto the tattoo bed, stencil side up

</div>

### Step 3: Prep skin

<div class="checklist">

- [ ] Wash your hands and put on some gloves
- [ ] Take your razor and shave very closely the area you're gonna tattoo + around 2 inches
- [ ] After the skin is shaved, use an alcohol pad or prep stuff to sterilize the skin

</div>

### Step 4: Apply stencil

<div class="checklist">

- [ ] Once the alcohol has dried, apply a moderately generous amount of stencil stuff to the area, spreading it with your finger to get an even thin coat
- [ ] Hold the stencil over the area and when really sure of placement apply it onto the skin starting from the middle
- [ ] Slowly stick the rest of the stencil to the skin with your finger working from the middle towards the outside
- [ ] Rub it slightly when it's all stuck to the skin
- [ ] Slowly peel the stencil off
- [ ] Leave to dry for around 10 minutes

</div>

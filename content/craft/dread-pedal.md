This was my first effect pedal built. It is based on a clone of the Boss DS-1 classic distortion pedal. I was built for my music project [Blood and Dust](https://blood-and-dust.com) as part of an effect chain we use on a cello. It is primarily used to make sounds heavier, grittier and add this sense of dread that is permeating our music.

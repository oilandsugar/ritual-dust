I made this mask out of leather for Voidxwitch, initially for a music video but also for live performances. This mask represents the character of the Beast of the Black Hill, a kind of werewolf summoned from the forest-covered hill from behind their childhood home.

The design of it was based on bdsm puppy masks, I made it fully adjustable for comfort and made the muzzle removable to make it easier to sing while wearing it. The final touch is all the piercings and studs that decorate it.

Over the last few months I did a lot of research on ancient and folk music, specifically of Celtic origins and on the instruments that were used to make such music. I first found out about the Irish bones and then about the bodhran.

I have a strong tendency towards percussion instruments in my own music playing so I decided to make myself a bodhran from [a kit I found online](https://mcneelamusic.com/percussion/make-your-own-bodhran-d-i-y-bodhran-kit/) and give it the look and finish I wanted.

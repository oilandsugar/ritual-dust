### Forest gardens

The practice of cultivating forests for food and medecine is ancient and has been an integral part of many indigenous cultures land management approaches. Often when colonizers encountered indigenous forest gardens, they only saw wilderness ready to be exploited as a resource instead of being nurtured and adapted to human needs. Permaculture is trying to bring the practice of forest gardening back into our ways of growing and harvesting food and managing forests. Food forests are self-sustaining due to the diversity of native plants and trees used and can sustain a community for generations.

### Coppicing

Coppicing is a traditional method of woodland management used since the prehistoric times which exploits the capacity of many species of trees to put out new shoots from their stump or roots if cut down. These shoots can then be harvested again at different stages of growth, either young for use in waddle fencing, older as straight poles or when mature as lumber. When these new shoots are cut the cycle starts again, the tree staying at a young age preventing it from dying of old age.

Areas of forest used for coppicing are usually cut in rotation,

Species of trees that can be coppiced:
- Willow
- Hazel
- Oak
- Ash
- Chesnut
- Osier

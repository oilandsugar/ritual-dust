In preparation for our upcoming trip to Ireland and as part of the musical work I've been doing for Earthworks and my album I decided to put together a little kit to do field recordings. 

My goals with it were to have something portable, that would allow for stereo recording in different configurations, that could be attached to a tripod with a camera and for it to be quite sensitive to pick up ambiences well.

I already had a portable recorder that could work pretty well for the job and a couple of rig parts from previous camera setups that I could use in this project.

From there I decided to go with a pair of LOM UÅ¡i microphones after them being recommended by a good friend. They're really sensitive, small and somewhat affordable for their quality. LOM also makes some really nice shock absorber holder for them so I got these too. 

I then proceeded to review different designs of stereo bars, some really simple, some over-complicated and in the end since i don't have access to a mill or cnc cutter i went with a simple design that could be done with stock aluminum and only drilled holes for assembly. The way I designed it the small middle part can be attached to any cold shoe mount and the two arms can rotate around. 

My next steps for this project will be making an adapter from the center pole of my tripod to two cold shoes, one for this stereo bar and the other one for the recorder, that way I can have a camera mounted on the top of the tripod an also have the stereo bar and the recorder on there at the same time, allowing me to film static landscape shots and record its ambience.

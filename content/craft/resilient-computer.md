I've been thinking about making a portable low-power resilient computer for
quite a while and have been slowly assembling the parts that i'll use to make it.
My main goal with it is to have a backup computer if my macbook crashes.

## It needs to
- run all the software tools I need to daily and creative tasks
- work offline and connect to the internet
- run on battery power, grid power or solar power
- is easy to repair and upgrade if needed

## Parts acquired so far
- Raspberry Pi 4 (dimensions 4” x 2.75” x 0.75”)
- Anker external battery
- Used pelican case
- Old bluetooth apple keyboard (will be retrofitted to run without batteries)
- Switch for power source
- old wireless mac keyboard

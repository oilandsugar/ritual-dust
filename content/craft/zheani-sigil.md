I made this carved sigil for my partner Hex before we got to see [Zheani](https://zheani.com/) live in Brooklyn. The intention behind it was to make it a reminder of their strength and will and ward them from self-doubt and haters. 

It had been a long time since I had done any wood carving but it was a very welcome change of craft. Zheani’s sigil was very fit to be carved with it’s sharp angles it ended up looking really good with some areas deeper than other. I finished the whole piece except the sigil with black paint and painted a quote from [one of Zheani's songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoUejI6Jnlg) around the edge at the request of Hex "The kids that once harassed me Will never fucking pass me".

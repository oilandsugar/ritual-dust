This coat hanger is built in a mix of neo-gothic and eastlake styles out of knotty pine, with moldings and cutout details. The hardware is cast iron and comes from a local company. The whole thing was stained and weathered to look like an antique piece of furniture and hopefully it lives long enough to become one.

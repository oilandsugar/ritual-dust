The original vambits were a small run of laser cut acrylic toys designed by the folks at [Hundred Rabbits](100r.co), I had it laying around on my desk for years and it always had a missing art and antler. Since it was already a bit damaged it gave me the idea of making it really rough looking while practicing my miniature painting skills at the same time.

### Needles

Needles come pre-packaged in a sterile package either with just the needle, the needle and a disposable tube or needle in a cartridge (for rotary machines). Needles have an expiry date so check that.

Needle codes looks like this: **9RL**
In which the **9** is the amount of needles and **RL** is the type of needle, in this case a round liner.

### Needle Types

<details>
<summary><h4>Round Liners (RL)</h4></summary>
Needles grouped in a circle, good for lines, needles are more tightly packed together.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Flat liners (FL)</h4></summary>
Single row of needles, used for lining and whip shading.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Round shaders (RS)</h4></summary>
Similar to round liner needles but with the needles spread out more for easier shading.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Magnum (M1 - weaved or M2 - stacked or RM - round grouping)</h4></summary>
Needles lined up in a row to cover more ground, there is two types of magnum needles, weaved and stacked, weaved magnums have the needle more spaced out than stacked magnums.
Magnums can have a flat or round grouping, meaning that either all the needles get equally deep in the skin in the ones in the middle go deeper than the ones on the side.

<details>
<summary><h4>Bug pin</h4></summary>
Needles are needles made using smaller individual needles than standard needles, all types of needle stacks can come with bug pin needles.

### Machines

There is coil machines and rotary machines. Coil machines use electromagnets in a simple circuit with a spring and contact screw in order to create the reciprocating action needed to tattoo. Coil machines on the other hand use a rotary motor that drives a cam connected to the needle to make it go in and out the skin.

More and more, tattoo artists are moving from using coil machines to using rotary machines, the main advantages being ease of setup and tuning, reduced noise and vibration and ability to use needle cartridge and change needles easily on the same machine during a session. The rest of this guide will be oriented towards rotary machines.

Machine accessories to keep in stock:
- Rubber nipples (to connect the needle to the bar)
- Rubber bands (to keep the needle against the back the tube)
- Machine bags
- Cable bags

### Machine types / configurations

when coil machines were the main type of machines used for tattooing, often artists would have multiple ones, setup differently for different tasks. Here's a list of the different uses and what characteristics are most desirable for the task. Some newer rotary machines have adjustable configurations that allow to do most of those with a single machine.

Used with thinner lining ink, runs fast and has the shortest stroke

## Supplies

[Inks](#inks)

</div>

### Inks

Tattoo inks are made from pigments suspended in a liquid.

## Technique

### Skin prep

Before any work can begin, the area of the skin to be tattooed has to be shaved closely and disinfected. This is to avoid pushing hairs or bacteria and viruses that could be living on the skin inside the body and potentially creating infection. It will also prepare the skin to receive the stencil.

### Stencil

A stencil is an image used as a reference while tattooing, it can be either drawn freehand with a skin-safe disposable marker or transferred on the skin with stencil paper. Stencil paper can be used with a thermal printer or by hand by drawing over it.

### Lining

Once the stencil applied

### Shading

Once the lines completed, if the tattoo has any shaded areas,

### General studio layout advice

- Have a sink dedicated to hand washing in tattoo room
- Have a separate sterilization room, don’t wash hands in contaminated sink
- Have a bathroom used just for bathroom stuff
- Put signs with hand washing instructions at every sink
- Put "do not touch" signs and biohazard signs on all surfaces that should not be touched (workstation, garbage bin, etc.)
- Make sure all surfaces are non porous in bathroom and tattoo room
- Keep wall mounted liquid hand soap and wall mounted paper towel dispenser beside each sink
- Keep hand sanitizer in tattoo room near workstation and in entrance
- Keep all equipment in drawers until it needs to be used

### Sharps and sharps disposal

- Always use single use and disposable sharps (needles, razors, etc)
- Inspect packaging of pre-sterilize sharps to make sure it’s not been compromised
- Dispose immediately after use in a sharps container
- Dispose of the full sharps container when it’s 3/4 full
- Install the sharps container on a proper wall mount as close as practical to the use area
- Look into service that picks up biohazard waste

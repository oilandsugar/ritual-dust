I recently had the chance to work on the soundtrack for a narrated story called "Crust" released on the [Library of the Occult](https://libraryoftheoccult.bandcamp.com/) label with [Blood and Dust](https://blood-and-dust.com/). The story is set in 1976 in rural England in the little town of Greenwood located close to a bog called Andertons Moss where in 1951 a well preserved prehistoric bog body apparently offered to the waters as ritual sacrifice was discovered.

These paper documents are ones that the main protagonist of the story, an archeologist looking for the truth behind Andertons Man's death, encounters during her research. I made those to bring the story to life and give it a more tactile and physical presence.

A variety of papers and cardstock were used to match what would have been used in reality, like heavy white cardstock for the museum label, newsprint for the newspaper clipping and a thin off-white paper for the leaflet.

You can listen to the whole story and it's soundtrack on Bandcamp: [Crust story narrated by Peter Baker](https://libraryoftheoccult.bandcamp.com/album/crust-narrated-by-peter-baker).

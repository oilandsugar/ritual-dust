[Suffer Puppet](https://sufferpuppet.com/) started as a fictionnal game I made for the music video of the song with the same name by Voidxwitch. Our concept for the music video involved a character playing a PS1 game in which they would beat up predators and creepy dudes in a silent-hill inspired town and at some point, the protagonist of the game would come out of the TV to come in the real world.

But as I worked on the 3D scenes and characters I started to wonder how hard it would be to turn it into a real game instead of just some animated scenes. Turn out it's quite a bit of work, but I was able to set the bases quickly enough to want to commit to making it a reality.

Suffer Puppet is inspired by old-school survival horror games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, Souls games and games like What Remains of Edith Finch.

In Suffer Puppet you will fight enemies, solve puzzles, explore a familiar yet unsettling world and slowly uncover memories in order to be able to get revenge and free yourself from those who controlled and abused you.

As I develop the game more I'll update this page and share more in-depth devlogs on my [patreon](https://patreon.com/ritualdust).

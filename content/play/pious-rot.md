[Pious Rot](https://piousrot.com/) is a system-agnostic world setting for fantasy roleplay steeped in folk traditions and the common folks strife against uncaring gods. It is a passion project that I share with my friend Sedge who does most of the writing for it. 

My main intention in creating this world is inspring people to tell new and different stories. Stories that can entertain and bring joy to the players and storytellers but also stories that allow us to envision a different future, a future in which power-hungry and extractive powers that drain the life out of the land are being toppled. A future in which violence and combat are not the primary mode of problem-solving (even though they have a place). A future in which the is important roles in society for disabled, queer and neurodivergent folks, where old and young folks are treated with respect and seen as wisdom holders.

The world of Pious is called Thiusland, and the continent we ware currently exploring is divided in regions with no borders in between. We are currently working on the Northern region first, which will have it's own booklet of lore, locations, people and more.

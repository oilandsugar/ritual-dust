## Steps

1. Boil **1 small potato** in water until it is soft when poked with a fork, around *15 min*
2. Let the potato cool, when it is safe to handle, remove its skin and put in large mixing bowl
3. Add **1 tsp of vegan butter** and **1/2 tsp of vanilla extract** to the potato and mash very well until there is no more clumps
4. Add **3 cups powdered sugar** to the potato mixture in small batches while mixing together, it should create a semi-firm dough. If after the 3 cups the dough is still very runny, add more powdered sugar until a better consistency is achieved
5. Lay down a large piece of plastic film on a flat surface and spread the dough on it to create a long rectangle, approximately *4" wide*
6. Spread **4 tbsp of peanut butter** evenly on top of the dough rectangle
7. Grab the plastic film on one of the long sides and carefully roll the dough in roll. Keep the film wrapped around the roll tightly to help it keep it's shape and place it into the refrigerator for a couple hours to harden
8. When the roll feel more firm, unwrap the plastic film and cut the roll into slices, enjoy!

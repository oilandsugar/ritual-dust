This little guide act as a reminder for our own little balcony garden of fresh herbs so the tips will be tailored for herbs growing in terra cotta pots outside on a balcony.

## Herb growing and care

For now we've only planted herbs from starter plants but I plan to try sprouting seeds that I collected from previous plants next year and take notes of the process.

Here's a good guide on when to plant them, in which type of soil and in which sun exposure: [https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/d6/garden_guide_growing_herbs.pdf](https://www.almanac.com/sites/default/files/d6/garden_guide_growing_herbs.pdf)

Herbs in pots outdoor need a lot of water compared to plants indoor or even to herbs planted directly in the ground, make sure to check them regularly for signs of wilting or sagging and water them plenty during the warm months of summer.

## Harvesting

Useful harvesting rules to keep the plants in good health and growing more:

- Harvest new growth regularly while keeping bigger leaves at the bottom
- Harvest shoots just after a split to encourage the two smaller shoots to grow larger
- Don't let the herbs flower, it will change the taste and reduce the growth of new leaves

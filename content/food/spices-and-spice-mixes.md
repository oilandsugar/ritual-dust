This page contains my notes, discoveries and explorations with different spices, seasonings and mixes of spices. When I'm looking for spices to add to a dish I'm often going back to the same ones or thinking about it in terms of the type of cuisine and which spices are commonly used in that cuisne, which is fine most of the time but does not encourage exploration that much. In addition to spices and spice mix I'll also list my favorite seasonings and how I like to use them here.

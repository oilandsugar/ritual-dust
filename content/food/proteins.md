## Tofu
**11g protein per 100g**

Apart from being a source of protein it is a good source of iron and calcium. Tofu is pretty neutral and versatile, it is available in silky soft (perfect for desserts) to extra firm (good for meat-like textures). If used in salty meals it's best to marinate it and season it to give it more flavour.

For a better texture, freeze overnight, thaw the day of cooking and press for *15 to 30 minutes* before cooking.


## Seitan
**75g (35g absorbed by the body) protein per 100g**

Seitan is a dense, wheat-gluten based protein that packs a lot of protein, some iron and is super low in carbs (4g per 100g). Since a lot of spices are included in it's preparation it doesn't need much additional seasoning when cooking with it.

Hail seitan!

## Tempeh
**19g protein per 100g**

Tempeh is like a cousin of tofu, it's made of whole soybeans fermented in a block, it has an interesting texture and holds pretty well when cut in strips and cubes. Like the tofu it tastes best when seasoned or marinated, I've found it really good for BBQ recipes.

## Veggie Pâté
**between 4g and 9g protein per 100g, depending on recipe**

Veggie pâté is different from the previous protein sources since it's a combination of vegetables and beans to form a kind of spread. It is mostly intented for sandwiches or toasts, doesn't need extra seasoning and is pretty good eaten cold.

## Beans
### Soybeans
**18.2g protein per 100g**   
Soybeans are one of the rare complete proteins (containing all essential amino acids) in plant sources
### Lentils   
protein content: 9g protein per 100g  
### Large white beans  
protein content: 9g protein per 100g  
### Large white beans  
protein content: 9g protein per 100g


One downside of eating a lot of beans is feeling gassy or bloated, that is due to the oligosaccharides, a naturally occurring sugar molecule present in the beans that our body cannot break down in the stomach or small intestine.
To counteract that, soaking the beans in water for *8 to 12 hours* prior to cooking them can help breaking down these sugars.

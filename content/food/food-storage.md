## Why Storing Food?

To be able to cook food for yourself and the people that live close to you if a distaster or a shortage happen. We've seen how quickly our food supply chains fall appart at the beginning of the Covid pandemic. Most grocery stores in North america don't keep much inventory anymore, instead depending on "just on time" supply chains.

## Short to Medium Term

Pantry items ideally stored in well sealed containers

everyday stock of canned good for two weeks to a month's worth 

## Long Term

hard tack
honey
rations

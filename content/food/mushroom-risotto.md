## Steps

1. Roughly cut the mushrooms in medium sized-chunks
2. Heat up **4 cups of vegetable broth** in a pot until simmering, keep at that temperature throughout the cooking process, also keep a cup nearby to transfer the broth
3. Put **1 tablespoon of vegan butter** in a pan with the cut mushrooms and cook them slowly until they are slightly browned
4. Put the remaining **1 tablespoon of vegan butter** in a large pot and add **1 1/2 cups of arborio rice**, roast the rice on *high intensity* for *2-3 minutes* in the butter
5. Lower the burner of the rice to low and start adding the broth to the rice, 1 cup at a time, stirring while the rice cooks and absorbs the broth, then adding more
6. Once all the broth as been absorbed the rice should have doubled in size, it's time to add **1.5 cup of light beer** to the rice and cook it a bit more while stirring
7. Once the beer has absorbed, turn off the heat and add **3 tsp of fresh thyme**, **the cooked mushrooms**, **1/2 cup of vegan parmesan**, and some **salt and pepper to taste**, mix well to incorporate all the ingredients
8. Serve with some **chopped green onions or chives** and the leftover from the beer used to cook the risotto, enjoy!
